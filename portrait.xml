                    <lb n="10042"/><p> The wide playgrounds were swarming with boys. All were 
                        <lb n="10043"/>shouting and the prefects urged them on with strong cries. The 
                        <lb n="10044"/>evening air was pale and chilly and after every charge and thud 
                        <lb n="10045"/>of the footballers the greasy leather orb flew like a heavy bird 
                        <lb n="10046"/>through the grey light. He kept on the fringe of his line, out of 
                        <lb n="10047"/>sight of his prefect, out of the reach of the rude feet, feigning to 
                        <lb n="10048"/>run now and then. He felt his body small and weak amid the 
                        <lb n="10049"/>throng of players and his eyes were weak and watery. <persName> Rody 
                            <lb n="10050"/>Kickham</persName> was not like that: he would be captain of the third

                    <lb n="10052"/><p> <persName> Rody Kickham</persName> was a decent fellow but <persName> Nasty Roche</persName> was a 
                        <lb n="10053"/>stink. <persName> Rody Kickham</persName> had greaves in his number and a hamper 
                        <lb n="10054"/>in the refectory. <persName> Nasty Roche</persName> had big hands. He called the 
                        <lb n="10055"/>Friday pudding dog-in-the-blanket. And one day he had asked: </p>
                    <lb n="10056"/><p> <said who="Nasty Roche">―What is your name? </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10057"/><p> Stephen had answered: </p>

                    <lb n="10059"/><p> Then <persName> Nasty Roche</persName> had said: </p>
                    <lb n="10060"/><p> <said who="Nasty Roche">―What kind of a name is that? </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10061"/><p> And when <persName> Stephen</persName> had not been able to answer <persName> Nasty 
                            <lb n="10062"/>Roche</persName> had asked: </p>
                    <lb n="10063"/><p> <said who="Nasty Roche">―What is your father? </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10064"/><p> <persName> Stephen</persName> had answered: </p>
                    <lb n="10065"/><p> <said who="Stephen">―A gentleman. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10066"/><p> Then <persName> Nasty Roche</persName> had asked: </p>
                    <lb n="10067"/><p> <said who="Nasty Roche">―Is he a magistrate? </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10068"/><p> He crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line, 
                        <lb n="10069"/>making little runs now and then. But his hands were bluish 
                        <lb n="10070"/>with cold. He kept his hands in the sidepockets of his belted 
                        <lb n="10071"/>grey suit. That was a belt round his jacket. And belt was also to 
                        <lb n="10072"/>give a fellow a belt. One day a fellow had said to <persName> Cantwell</persName>: </p>
                    <lb n="10073"/><p> <said who="a fellow">―I'd give you such a belt in a second. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10074"/><p> <persName> Cantwell</persName> had answered: </p>
                    <lb n="10075"/><p> <said who="Cantwell">―Go and fight your match. Give <persName> Cecil Thunder</persName> a belt. I'd like 
                            <lb n="10076"/>to see you. He'd give you a toe in the rump for yourself. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10077"/><p> That was not a nice expression. His mother had told him 
                        <lb n="10078"/>not to speak with the rough boys in the college. Nice mother! 
                        <lb n="10079"/>The first day in the hall of the castle when she had said good- 
                        <lb n="10080"/>bye she had put up her veil double to her nose to kiss him: and 
                        <lb n="10081"/>her nose and eyes were red. But he had pretended not to see 
                        <lb n="10082"/>that she was going to cry. She was a nice mother but she was 
                        <lb n="10083"/>not so nice when she cried. And his father had given him two 
                        <lb n="10084"/><seg type="neologism"> fiveshilling </seg> pieces for pocket money. And his father had told 
                        <lb n="10085"/>him if he wanted anything to write home to him and, whatever 
                        <lb n="10086"/>he did, never to peach on a fellow. Then at the door of the 
                        <lb n="10087"/>castle the rector had shaken hands with his father and mother, 
                        <lb n="10088"/>his soutane fluttering in the breeze, and the car had driven off 
                        <lb n="10089"/>with his father and mother on it. They had cried to him from 
                        <lb n="10090"/>the car, waving their hands: </p>
                    <said who="Mary Dedalus, Simon Dedalus">
                        <lb n="10091"/><p>―Goodbye, <persName> Stephen</persName>, goodbye! </p>
                        <lb n="10092"/><p>―Goodbye, <persName> Stephen</persName>, goodbye! </p>
                    </said>
                    <lb n="10093"/><p> He was caught in the whirl of a scrimmage and, fearful of 
                        <lb n="10094"/>the flashing eyes and muddy boots, bent down to look through 
                        <lb n="10095"/>the legs. The fellows were struggling and groaning and their 
                        <lb n="10096"/>legs were rubbing and kicking and stamping. Then <persName> Jack 
                            <lb n="10097"/>Lawton</persName>'s yellow boots dodged out the ball and all the other 
                        <lb n="10098"/>boots and legs ran after. He ran after them a little way and then 
                        <lb n="10099"/>stopped. It was useless to run on. Soon they would be going 
                        <lb n="10100"/>home for the holidays. After supper in the <seg type="neologism"> studyhall </seg> he would 
                        <lb n="10101"/>change the number pasted up inside his desk from <seg type="neologism"> seventyseven </seg> 
                        <lb n="10102"/>to <seg type="neologism"> seventysix </seg>. </p>
                    <lb n="10103"/><p> It would be better to be in the <seg type="neologism"> studyhall </seg> than out there in the

                        <lb n="10105"/>castle. He wondered from which window <persName> Hamilton Rowan</persName> 
                        <lb n="10106"/>had thrown his hat on the haha and had there been flowerbeds 
                        <lb n="10107"/>at that time under the windows. One day when he had been 
                        <lb n="10108"/>called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the 
                        <lb n="10109"/>soldiers' slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a 
                        <lb n="10110"/>piece of shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and 
                        <lb n="10111"/>warm to see the lights in the castle. It was like something in a 
                        <lb n="10112"/>book. Perhaps <place> <location> <geo> 52.640379 -1.132563 </geo> </location> <placeName> Leicester Abbey </placeName> </place> was like that. And there were 
                        <lb n="10113"/>nice sentences in <persName> Doctor Cornwell</persName>'s Spelling Book. They were 
                        <lb n="10114"/>like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling

                        <lb n="10122"/>He shivered as if he had cold slimy water next his skin. That

                        <lb n="10125"/>soned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. How cold and

                        <lb n="10127"/>jump plop into the scum. He shivered and longed to cry. It 
                        <lb n="10128"/>would be so nice to be at home. Mother was sitting at the fire 
                        <lb n="10129"/>with <persName> Dante </persName> waiting for <persName> Brigid </persName> to bring in the tea. She had her 
                        <lb n="10130"/>feet on the fender and her jewelly slippers were so hot and they 
                        <lb n="10131"/>had such a lovely warm smell! <persName> Dante </persName> knew a lot of things. She 
                        <lb n="10132"/>had taught him where the <place> <location> <geo> -18.615949 41.280858 </geo> </location> <placeName> Mozambique Channel </placeName> </place> was and what

                        <lb n="10134"/>highest mountain in the moon. <persName> Father Arnall </persName> knew more than 
                        <lb n="10135"/><persName> Dante </persName> because he was a priest but both his father and <persName> uncle 
                            <lb n="10136"/>Charles </persName> said that <persName> Dante </persName> was a clever woman and a <seg type="neologism"> wellread </seg> 
                        <lb n="10137"/>woman. And when <persName> Dante </persName> made that noise after dinner and 
                        <lb n="10138"/>then put up her hand to her mouth: that was heartburn. </p>
                    <lb n="10139"/><p> A voice cried far out on the playground: </p>

                    <lb n="10141"/><p> Then other voices cried from the lower and third lines: </p>

                    <lb n="10143"/><p> The players closed around, flushed and muddy, and he went 
                        <lb n="10144"/>among them, glad to go in. <persName> Rody Kickham </persName> held the ball by its 
                        <lb n="10145"/>greasy lace. A fellow asked him to give it one last: but he 
                        <lb n="10146"/>walked on without even answering the fellow. <persName> Simon Moonan </persName> 
                        <lb n="10147"/>told him not to because the prefect was looking. The fellow 
                        <lb n="10148"/>turned to <persName> Simon Moonan </persName> and said: </p>
                    <lb n="10149"/><p> <said who="a fellow">―We all know why you speak. You are <persName> McGlade </persName>'s suck. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10150"/><p> Suck was a queer word. The fellow called <persName> Simon Moonan </persName> 
                        <lb n="10151"/>that name because <persName> Simon Moonan </persName> used to tie the prefect's false 
                        <lb n="10152"/>sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to be 
                        <lb n="10153"/>angry. But the sound was ugly. Once he had washed his hands 
                        <lb n="10154"/>in the lavatory of the <place> <location> <geo> 53.342872 -6.260651 </geo> </location> <placeName> Wicklow Hotel </placeName> </place> and his father pulled the 
                        <lb n="10155"/>stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down 
                        <lb n="10156"/>through the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down 
                        <lb n="10157"/>slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that: suck. 
                        <lb n="10158"/>Only louder. </p>
                    <lb n="10159"/><p> To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made 
                        <lb n="10160"/>him feel cold and then hot. There were two cocks that you 
                        <lb n="10161"/>turned and water came out: cold and hot. He felt cold and then 
                        <lb n="10162"/>a little hot: and he could see the names printed on the cocks. 
                        <lb n="10163"/>That was a very queer thing. </p>
                    <lb n="10164"/><p> And the air in the corridor chilled him too. It was queer and 
                        <lb n="10165"/>wettish. But soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a 
                        <lb n="10166"/>light noise like a little song. Always the same: and when the 
                        <lb n="10167"/>fellows stopped talking in the playroom you could hear it. </p>
                    <lb n="10168"/><p> It was the hour for sums. <persName> Father Arnall </persName> wrote a hard sum on 
                        <lb n="10169"/>the board and then said: </p>
                    <lb n="10170"/><p> <said who="Father Arnall">―Now then, who will win? Go ahead, York! Go ahead, Lan- 
                            <lb n="10171"/>caster! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10172"/><p> <persName> Stephen </persName> tried his best but the sum was too hard and he felt 
                        <lb n="10173"/>confused. The little silk badge with the white rose on it that 
                        <lb n="10174"/>was pinned on the breast of his jacket began to flutter. He was 
                        <lb n="10175"/>no good at sums but he tried his best so that York might not 
                        <lb n="10176"/>lose. <persName> Father Arnall </persName>'s face looked very black but he was not in a 
                        <lb n="10177"/>wax: he was laughing. Then <persName> Jack Lawton </persName> cracked his fingers 
                        <lb n="10178"/>and <persName> Father Arnall </persName> looked at his copybook and said: </p>
                    <lb n="10179"/><p> <said who="Father Arnall">―Right. Bravo Lancaster! The red rose wins. Come on now, 
                            <lb n="10180"/>York! Forge ahead! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10181"/><p> <persName> Jack Lawton </persName> looked over from his side. The little silk badge 
                        <lb n="10182"/>with the red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue 
                        <lb n="10183"/>sailor top on. <persName> Stephen </persName> felt his own face red too, thinking of all 
                        <lb n="10184"/>the bets about who would get first place in elements, <persName> Jack 
                            <lb n="10185"/>Lawton </persName> or he. Some weeks <persName> Jack Lawton </persName> got the card for first 
                        <lb n="10186"/>and some weeks he got the card for first. His white silk badge 
                        <lb n="10187"/>fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next sum and heard 
                        <lb n="10188"/><persName> Father Arnall </persName>'s voice. Then all his eagerness passed away and 
                        <lb n="10189"/>he felt his face quite cool. He thought his face must be white 
                        <lb n="10190"/>because it felt so cool. He could not get out the answer for the 
                        <lb n="10191"/>sum but it did not matter. White roses and red roses: those 
                        <lb n="10192"/>were beautiful colours to think of. And the cards for first place 
                        <lb n="10193"/>and second place and third place were beautiful colours too: 
                        <lb n="10194"/>pink and cream and lavender. Lavender and cream and pink 
                        <lb n="10195"/>roses were beautiful to think of. Perhaps a wild rose might be 
                        <lb n="10196"/>like those colours: and he remembered the song about the wild 
                        <lb n="10197"/>rose blossoms on the little green place. But you could not have 
                        <lb n="10198"/>a green rose. But perhaps somewhere in the world you could. </p>
                    <lb n="10199"/><p> The bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the 
                        <lb n="10200"/>rooms and along the corridors towards the refectory. He sat 
                        <lb n="10201"/>looking at the two prints of butter on his plate but could not 
                        <lb n="10202"/>eat the damp bread. The tablecloth was damp and limp. But he 
                        <lb n="10203"/>drank off the hot weak tea which the clumsy scullion, girt with 
                        <lb n="10204"/>a white apron, poured into his cup. He wondered whether the 
                        <lb n="10205"/>scullion's apron was damp too or whether all white things were 
                        <lb n="10206"/>cold and damp. <persName> Nasty Roche </persName> and <persName> Saurin </persName> drank cocoa that their 
                        <lb n="10207"/>people sent them in tins. They said they could not drink the tea; 
                        <lb n="10208"/>that it was hogwash. Their fathers were magistrates, the fel- 
                        <lb n="10209"/>lows said. </p>
                    <lb n="10210"/><p> All the boys seemed to him very strange. They had all fa- 
                        <lb n="10211"/>thers and mothers and different clothes and voices. He longed 
                        <lb n="10212"/>to be at home and lay his head on his mother's lap. But he 
                        <lb n="10213"/>could not: and so he longed for the play and study and prayers 
                        <lb n="10214"/>to be over and to be in bed. </p>
                    <lb n="10215"/><p> He drank another cup of hot tea and <persName> Fleming </persName> said: </p>
                    <lb n="10216"/><p> <said who="Fleming">―What's up? Have you a pain or what's up with you? </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10217"/><p> <said who="Stephen">―I don't know, <persName> Stephen </persName> said. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10218"/><p> <said who="Fleming">―Sick in your breadbasket, <persName> Fleming </persName> said, because your face 
                            <lb n="10219"/>looks white. It will go away. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10220"/><p> <said who="Stephen">―O yes, <persName> Stephen </persName> said. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10221"/><p> But he was not sick there. He thought that he was sick in his 
                        <lb n="10222"/>heart if you could be sick in that place. <persName> Fleming </persName> was very 
                        <lb n="10223"/>decent to ask him. He wanted to cry. He leaned his elbows on 
                        <lb n="10224"/>the table and shut and opened the flaps of his ears. Then he 
                        <lb n="10225"/>heard the noise of the refectory every time he opened the flaps 
                        <lb n="10226"/>of his ears. It made a roar like a train at night. And when he 
                        <lb n="10227"/>closed the flaps the roar was shut off like a train going into a 
                        <lb n="10228"/>tunnel. That night at <place> <location> <geo> 53.277911 -6.105844 </geo> </location> <placeName> Dalkey </placeName> </place> the train had roared like that and 
                        <lb n="10229"/>then, when it went into the tunnel, the roar stopped. He closed 
                        <lb n="10230"/>his eyes and the train went on, roaring and then stopping; 
                        <lb n="10231"/>roaring again, stopping. It was nice to hear it roar and stop and 
                        <lb n="10232"/>then roar out of the tunnel again and then stop. </p>
                    <lb n="10233"/><p> Then the higher line fellows began to come down along the 
                        <lb n="10234"/>matting in the middle of the refectory, <persName> Paddy Rath </persName> and <persName> Jimmy 
                            <lb n="10235"/>Magee </persName> and the Spaniard who was allowed to smoke cigars and 
                        <lb n="10236"/>the little Portuguese who wore the woolly cap. And then the 
                        <lb n="10237"/>lower line tables and the tables of the third line. And every 
                        <lb n="10238"/>single fellow had a different way of walking. </p>
                    <lb n="10239"/><p> He sat in a corner of the playroom pretending to watch a 
                        <lb n="10240"/>game of dominos and once or twice he was able to hear for an 
                        <lb n="10241"/>instant the little song of the gas. The prefect was at the door 
                        <lb n="10242"/>with some boys and <persName> Simon Moonan </persName> was knotting his false 
                        <lb n="10243"/>sleeves. He was telling them something about <place> <location> <geo> 52.888640 -8.428450 </geo> </location> <placeName> Tullabeg </placeName> </place>. </p>
                    <lb n="10244"/><p> Then he went away from the door and <persName> Wells </persName> came over to 
                        <lb n="10245"/><persName> Stephen </persName> and said: </p>
                    <lb n="10246"/><p> <said who="Wells">―Tell us, <persName> Dedalus </persName>, do you kiss your mother every night before 
                            <lb n="10247"/>you go to bed? </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10248"/><p> <persName> Stephen </persName> answered: </p>
                    <lb n="10249"/><p> <said who="Stephen">―I do. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10250"/><p> <persName> Wells </persName> turned to the other fellows and said: </p>
                    <lb n="10251"/><p> <said who="Wells">―O, I say, here's a fellow says he kisses his mother every night 
                            <lb n="10252"/>before he goes to bed. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10253"/><p> The other fellows stopped their game and turned round, 
                        <lb n="10254"/>laughing. <persName> Stephen </persName> blushed under their eyes and said: </p>
                    <lb n="10255"/><p> <said who="Stephen">―I do not. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10256"/><p> <persName> Wells </persName> said: </p>
                    <lb n="10257"/><p> <said who="Wells">―O, I say, here's a fellow says he doesn't kiss his mother 
                            <lb n="10258"/>before he goes to bed. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10259"/><p> They all laughed again. <persName> Stephen </persName> tried to laugh with them. 
                        <lb n="10260"/>He felt his whole body hot and confused in a moment. What 
                        <lb n="10261"/>was the right answer to the question? He had given two and 
                        <lb n="10262"/>still <persName> Wells </persName> laughed. But <persName> Wells </persName> must know the right answer for 
                        <lb n="10263"/>he was in third of grammar. He tried to think of <persName> Wells </persName>'s mother 
                        <lb n="10264"/>but he did not dare to raise his eyes to <persName> Wells </persName>'s face. He did not 
                        <lb n="10265"/>like <persName> Wells </persName>'s face. It was <persName> Wells </persName> who had shouldered him into the 
                        <lb n="10266"/>square ditch the day before because he would not swop his 
                        <lb n="10267"/>little <seg type="neologism"> snuffbox </seg> for <persName> Wells </persName>'s seasoned hacking chestnut, the con- 
                        <lb n="10268"/>queror of forty. It was a mean thing to do; all the fellows said it 
                        <lb n="10269"/>was. And how cold and slimy the water had been! And a fellow 
                        <lb n="10270"/>had once seen a big rat jump plop into the scum. </p>
                    <lb n="10271"/><p> The cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, 
                        <lb n="10272"/>when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the 
                        <lb n="10273"/>playrooms, he felt the cold air of the corridor and staircase 
                        <lb n="10274"/>inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right 
                        <lb n="10275"/>answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his 
                        <lb n="10276"/>mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like 
                        <lb n="10277"/>that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face down. 
                        <lb n="10278"/>That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips 
                        <lb n="10279"/>were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little 
                        <lb n="10280"/>noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces? </p>
                    <lb n="10281"/><p> Sitting in the <seg type="neologism"> studyhall </seg> he opened the lid of his desk and 
                        <lb n="10282"/>changed the number pasted up inside from <seg type="neologism"> seventyseven </seg> to 
                        <lb n="10283"/><seg type="neologism"> seventysix </seg>. But the Christmas vacation was very far away: but 
                        <lb n="10284"/>one time it would come because the earth moved round always. </p>
                    <lb n="10285"/><p> There was a picture of the earth on the first page of his 
                        <lb n="10286"/>geography: a big ball in the middle of clouds. <persName> Fleming </persName> had a 
                        <lb n="10287"/>box of crayons and one night during free study he had coloured 
                        <lb n="10288"/>the earth green and the clouds maroon. That was like the two 
                        <lb n="10289"/>brushes in <persName> Dante </persName>'s press, the brush with the green velvet back 
                        <lb n="10290"/>for <persName> Parnell </persName> and the brush with the maroon velvet back for 
                        <lb n="10291"/><persName> Michael Davitt </persName>. But he had not told <persName> Fleming </persName> to colour them 
                        <lb n="10292"/>those colours. <persName> Fleming </persName> had done it himself. </p>
                    <lb n="10293"/><p> He opened the geography to study the lesson; but he could 
                        <lb n="10294"/>not learn the names of places in <placeName> America </placeName>. Still they were all 
                        <lb n="10295"/>different places that had those different names. They were all in 
                        <lb n="10296"/>different countries and the countries were in continents and the 
                        <lb n="10297"/>continents were in the world and the world was in the universe. </p>
                    <lb n="10298"/><p> He turned to the flyleaf of the geography and read what he 
                        <lb n="10299"/>had written there: himself, his name and where he was. </p>

                        <lb n="10316"/>Then he read the flyleaf from the bottom to the top till he came 
                        <lb n="10317"/>to his own name. That was he: and he read down the page 
                        <lb n="10318"/>again. What was after <placeName> the universe </placeName>? Nothing. But was there 
                        <lb n="10319"/>anything round <placeName> the universe </placeName> to show where it stopped before 
                        <lb n="10320"/>the nothing place began? It could not be a wall but there could 
                        <lb n="10321"/>be a thin thin line there all round everything. It was very big to 
                        <lb n="10322"/>think about everything and everywhere. Only <persName> God </persName> could do 
                        <lb n="10323"/>that. He tried to think what a big thought that must be but he 
                        <lb n="10324"/>could think only of <persName> God </persName>. <persName> God </persName> was <persName> God </persName>'s name just as his name 
                        <lb n="10325"/>was <persName> Stephen </persName>. <persName> <emph> Dieu </emph> </persName> was the French for <persName> God </persName> and that was <persName> God </persName>'s 
                        <lb n="10326"/>name too; and when anyone prayed to <persName> God </persName> and said <persName> <emph> Dieu </emph> </persName> then 
                        <lb n="10327"/><persName> God </persName> knew at once that it was a French person that was pray- 
                        <lb n="10328"/>ing. But though there were different names for <persName> God </persName> in all the 
                        <lb n="10329"/>different languages in the world and <persName> God </persName> understood what all 
                        <lb n="10330"/>the people who prayed said in their different languages still 
                        <lb n="10331"/><persName> God </persName> remained always the same <persName> God </persName> and <persName> God </persName>'s real name was

                    <lb n="10333"/><p> It made him very tired to think that way. It made him feel 
                        <lb n="10334"/>his head very big. He turned over the flyleaf and looked wearily 
                        <lb n="10335"/>at the green round earth in the middle of the maroon clouds. 
                        <lb n="10336"/>He wondered which was right, to be for the green or for the 
                        <lb n="10337"/>maroon, because <persName> Dante </persName> had ripped the green velvet back off 
                        <lb n="10338"/>the brush that was for <persName> Parnell </persName> one day with her scissors and 
                        <lb n="10339"/>had told him that <persName> Parnell </persName> was a bad man. He wondered if they 
                        <lb n="10340"/>were arguing at home about that. That was called politics. 
                        <lb n="10341"/>There were two sides in it: <persName> Dante </persName> was on one side and his 
                        <lb n="10342"/>father and <persName> Mr Casey </persName> were on the other side but his mother and 
                        <lb n="10343"/><persName> uncle Charles </persName> were on no side. Every day there was something 
                        <lb n="10344"/>in the paper about it. </p>
                    <lb n="10345"/><p> It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant 
                        <lb n="10346"/>and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt 
                        <lb n="10347"/>small and weak. When would he be like the fellows in poetry 
                        <lb n="10348"/>and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they 
                        <lb n="10349"/>studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the 
                        <lb n="10350"/>vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and 
                        <lb n="10351"/>then again another term and then again the vacation. It was 
                        <lb n="10352"/>like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the 
                        <lb n="10353"/>noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and 
                        <lb n="10354"/>closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, 
                        <lb n="10355"/>stop. How far away it was! It was better to go to bed to sleep. 
                        <lb n="10356"/>Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and 
                        <lb n="10357"/>yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit hot. 
                        <lb n="10358"/>First they were so cold to get into. He shivered to think how 
                        <lb n="10359"/>cold they were first. But then they got hot and then he could 
                        <lb n="10360"/>sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night prayers 
                        <lb n="10361"/>and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be 
                        <lb n="10362"/>lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from 
                        <lb n="10363"/>the cold shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm 
                        <lb n="10364"/>all over, ever so warm; ever so warm and yet he shivered a little 
                        <lb n="10365"/>and still wanted to yawn. </p>
                    <lb n="10366"/><p> The bell rang for night prayers and he filed out of the <seg type="neologism"> study- 
                            <lb n="10367"/>hall </seg> after the others and down the staircase and along the 
                        <lb n="10368"/>corridors to the chapel. The corridors were darkly lit and the 
                        <lb n="10369"/>chapel was darkly lit. Soon all would be dark and sleeping. 
                        <lb n="10370"/>There was cold night air in the chapel and the marbles were the 
                        <lb n="10371"/>colour the sea was at night. The sea was cold day and night: 
                        <lb n="10372"/>but it was colder at night. It was cold and dark under the 
                        <lb n="10373"/>seawall beside his father's house. But the kettle would be on the 
                        <lb n="10374"/>hob to make punch. </p>
                    <lb n="10375"/><p> The prefect of the chapel prayed above his head and his 
                        <lb n="10376"/>memory knew the responses: </p>
                    <lg type="prayer">

                    </lg>
                    <lb n="10381"/><p> There was a cold night smell in the chapel. But it was a holy

                        <lb n="10383"/>the back of the chapel at Sunday mass. That was a smell of air 
                        <lb n="10384"/>and rain and turf and corduroy. But they were very holy peas- 
                        <lb n="10385"/>ants. They breathed behind him on his neck and sighed as they 
                        <lb n="10386"/>prayed. They lived in <place> <location> <geo> 53.293785 -6.687040 </geo> </location> <placeName> Clane </placeName>, </place>, a fellow said: there were little

                        <lb n="10390"/>that cottage before the fire of smoking turf, in the dark lit by 
                        <lb n="10391"/>the fire, in the warm dark, breathing the smell of the peasants, 
                        <lb n="10392"/>air and rain and turf and corduroy. But, O, the road there 
                        <lb n="10393"/>between the trees was dark! You would be lost in the dark. It 
                        <lb n="10394"/>made him afraid to think of how it was. </p>
                    <lb n="10395"/><p> He heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the last 
                        <lb n="10396"/>prayer. He prayed it too against the dark outside under the

                        <lb n="10406"/>was lowered so that he might not go to hell when he died. He

                        <lb n="10409"/>quickly fearing that the gas would go down. He felt his shoul-

                        <lb n="10419"/>gether under the cold white sheets, shaking and trembling. But 
                        <lb n="10420"/>he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking would 
                        <lb n="10421"/>stop. A voice bade the boys in the dormitory goodnight. He 
                        <lb n="10422"/>peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow 
                        <lb n="10423"/>curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides. 
                        <lb n="10424"/>The light was lowered quietly. </p>

                        <lb n="10428"/>with eyes as big as <seg type="neologism"> carriagelamps </seg>? They said it was the ghost of

                        <lb n="10430"/>the dark entrance hall of the castle. Old servants in old dress 
                        <lb n="10431"/>were in the <seg type="neologism"> ironingroom </seg> above the staircase. It was long ago.

                        <lb n="10433"/>was still dark. A figure came up the staircase from the hall. He 
                        <lb n="10434"/>wore the white cloak of a marshal; his face was pale and 
                        <lb n="10435"/>strange; he held his hand pressed to his side. He looked out of 
                        <lb n="10436"/>strange eyes at the old servants. They looked at him and saw

                        <lb n="10535"/>their sides. Their coats dried then. They were only dead things. </p>
                    <lb n="10536"/><p> The prefect was there again and it was his voice that was 
                        <lb n="10537"/>saying that he was to get up, that <persName> Father Minister </persName> had said he 
                        <lb n="10538"/>was to get up and dress and go to the infirmary. And while he 
                        <lb n="10539"/>was dressing himself as quickly as he could the prefect said: </p>
                    <lb n="10540"/><p> <said who="the prefect">―We must pack off to <persName> Brother Michael </persName> because we have the 
                            <lb n="10541"/>collywobbles. Terrible thing to have the collywobbles! How we 
                            <lb n="10542"/>wobble when we have the collywobbles! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10543"/><p> He was very decent to say that. That was all to make him 
                        <lb n="10544"/>laugh. But he could not laugh because his cheeks and lips were 
                        <lb n="10545"/>all shivery: and then the prefect had to laugh by himself. </p>
                    <lb n="10546"/><p> The prefect cried: </p>
                    <lb n="10547"/><p> <said who="the prefect">―Quick march! Hayfoot! Strawfoot! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10548"/><p> They went together down the staircase and along the corri- 
                        <lb n="10549"/>dor and past the bath. As he passed the door he remembered 
                        <lb n="10550"/>with a vague fear the warm <seg type="neologism"> turfcoloured </seg> bogwater, the warm 
                        <lb n="10551"/>moist air, the noise of plunges, the smell of the towels, like 
                        <lb n="10552"/>medicine. </p>
                    <lb n="10553"/><p> <persName> Brother Michael </persName> was standing at the door of the infirmary 
                        <lb n="10554"/>and from the door of the dark cabinet on his right came a smell 
                        <lb n="10555"/>like medicine. That came from the bottles on the shelves. The 
                        <lb n="10556"/>prefect spoke to <persName> Brother Michael </persName> and <persName> Brother Michael </persName> 
                        <lb n="10557"/>answered and called the prefect sir. He had reddish hair mixed 
                        <lb n="10558"/>with grey and a queer look. It was queer that he would always 
                        <lb n="10559"/>be a brother. It was queer too that you could not call him sir 
                        <lb n="10560"/>because he was a brother and had a different kind of look. Was 
                        <lb n="10561"/>he not holy enough or why could he not catch up on the others? </p>
                    <lb n="10562"/><p> There were two beds in the room and in one bed there was a 
                        <lb n="10563"/>fellow: and when they went in he called out: </p>
                    <lb n="10564"/><p> <said who="Athy">―Hello! It's young <persName> Dedalus </persName>! What's up? </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10565"/><p> <said who="Brother Michael">―The sky is up, <persName> Brother Michael </persName> said. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10566"/><p> He was a fellow out of the third of grammar and, while <persName> Stephen </persName> 
                        <lb n="10567"/>was undressing, he asked <persName> Brother Michael </persName> to bring him a round 
                        <lb n="10568"/>of buttered toast. </p>
                    <p><said who="Athy">―Ah, do!</said> he said. <lb n="10569"></lb></p>
                    <lb n="10570"/><p> <said who="Brother Michael">―Butter you up! said <persName> Brother Michael </persName>. You'll get your walking 
                            <lb n="10571"/>papers in the morning when the doctor comes. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10572"/><p> <said who="Athy">―Will I?</said> the fellow said. <said who="Athy">I'm not well yet. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10573"/><p> <persName> Brother Michael </persName> repeated: </p>
                    <lb n="10574"/><p> <said who="Athy">―You'll get your walking papers, I tell you. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10575"/><p> He bent down to rake the fire. He had a long back like the 
                        <lb n="10576"/>long back of a <seg type="neologism"> tramhorse </seg>. He shook the poker gravely and 
                        <lb n="10577"/>nodded his head at the fellow out of third of grammar. </p>
                    <lb n="10578"/><p> Then <persName> Brother Michael </persName> went away and after a while the fel- 
                        <lb n="10579"/>low out of third of grammar turned in towards the wall and fell 
                        <lb n="10580"/>asleep. </p>
                    <lb n="10581"/><p> That was the infirmary. He was sick then. Had they written

                        <lb n="10583"/>one of the priests to go himself to tell them. Or he would write 
                        <lb n="10584"/>a letter for the priest to bring. </p>

                        <lb n="10592"/>the same on a sunny day. He might die before his mother came. 
                        <lb n="10593"/>Then he would have a dead mass in the chapel like the way the 
                        <lb n="10594"/>fellows had told him it was when <persName> Little </persName> had died. All the fellows would be at the mass, dressed in black, all with sad faces. 
                        <lb n="10596"/><persName> Wells </persName> too would be there but no fellow would look at him. The

                        <lb n="10598"/>would be tall yellow candles on the altar and round the cata-

                        <lb n="10600"/>slowly and he would be buried in the little graveyard of the

                        <lb n="10671"/>shilling when he asked for sixpence and he felt sorry for him 
                        <lb n="10672"/>that he was not a magistrate like the other boys' fathers. Then 
                        <lb n="10673"/>why was he sent to that place with them? But his father had 
                        <lb n="10674"/>told him that he would be no stranger there because his grand- 
                        <lb n="10675"/>uncle had presented an address to the liberator there fifty years 
                        <lb n="10676"/>before. You could know the people of that time by their old 
                        <lb n="10677"/>dress. It seemed to him a solemn time: and he wondered if that 
                        <lb n="10678"/>was the time when the fellows in <placeName> Clongowes </placeName> wore blue coats 
                        <lb n="10679"/>with brass buttons and yellow waistcoats and caps of <seg type="neologism"> rabbit-

                    <lb n="10682"/><p> He looked at the window and saw that the daylight had

                        <lb n="10684"/>grounds. There was no noise on the playgrounds. The class 
                        <lb n="10685"/>must be doing the themes or perhaps <persName> Father Arnall </persName> was reading 
                        <lb n="10686"/>a legend out of the book. </p>
                    <lb n="10687"/><p> It was queer that they had not given him any medicine. 
                        <lb n="10688"/>Perhaps <persName> Brother Michael </persName> would bring it back when he came. 
                        <lb n="10689"/>They said you got stinking stuff to drink when you were in the

                        <lb n="10691"/>getting better slowly. You could get a book then. There was a 
                        <lb n="10692"/>book in the library about <placeName> Holland </placeName>. There were lovely foreign 
                        <lb n="10693"/>names in it and pictures of <seg type="neologism"> strangelooking </seg> cities and ships. It

                        <lb n="10696"/>The fire rose and fell on the wall. It was like waves. Someone 
                        <lb n="10697"/>had put coal on and he heard voices. They were talking. It was 
                        <lb n="10698"/>the noise of the waves. Or the waves were talking among them- 
                        <lb n="10699"/>selves as they rose and fell. </p>
                    <lb n="10700"/><p> He saw the sea of waves, long dark waves rising and falling, 
                        <lb n="10701"/>dark under the moonless night. A tiny light twinkled at the 
                        <lb n="10702"/>pierhead where the ship was entering: and he saw a multitude 
                        <lb n="10703"/>of people gathered by the waters' edge to see the ship that was 
                        <lb n="10704"/>entering their harbour. A tall man stood on the deck, looking 
                        <lb n="10705"/>out towards the flat dark land: and by the light at the pierhead 
                        <lb n="10706"/>he saw his face, the sorrowful face of <persName> Brother Michael </persName>. </p>
                    <lb n="10707"/><p> He saw him lift his hand towards the people and heard him 
                        <lb n="10708"/>say in a loud voice of sorrow over the waters: </p>
                    <lb n="10709"/><p> <said who="Brother Michael">―He is dead. We saw him lying upon the catafalque. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10710"/><p> A wail of sorrow went up from the people. </p>
                    <lb n="10711"/><p> <said who="the people">―<persName>Parnell</persName>! <persName> Parnell </persName>! He is dead! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="10712"/><p> They fell upon their knees, moaning in sorrow. </p>
                    <lb n="10713"/><p> And he saw <persName> Dante </persName> in a maroon velvet dress and with a green 
                        <lb n="10714"/>velvet mantle hanging from her shoulders walking proudly and

                        <lb n="10730"/>time to time, he withdrew a hand from his coattail to wax out 
                        <lb n="10731"/>one of his moustache ends. <persName>Mr Casey</persName> leaned his head to one

                        <lb n="10754"/>see how much he had poured in. Then replacing the jar in the

                        <lb n="10992"/>near him at the fire, looking up at his dark fierce face. But his 
                        <lb n="10993"/>dark eyes were never fierce and his slow voice was good to 
                        <lb n="10994"/>listen to. But why was he then against the priests? Because 
                        <lb n="10995"/>Dante must be right then. But he had heard his father say that

                        <lb n="10997"/>in the Alleghanies when her brothers had got the money from 
                        <lb n="10998"/>the savages for the trinkets and  <seg type="neologism">chainies</seg>. Perhaps that made her

                        <lb n="11000"/>Eileen because Eileen was a protestant and when she was 
                        <lb n="11001"/>young she knew children that used to play with protestants and 
                        <lb n="11002"/>the protestants used to make fun of the litany of the Blessed

                        <lb n="11007"/>and the moan of sorrow from the people when they had heard. </p>

                        <lb n="11118"/><said who="Dante">―God and religion before everything! Dante cried. God and

                    <lb n="11120"/><p>  Mr Casey raised his clenched fist and brought it down on 
                        <lb n="11121"/>the table with a crash.

                    <lb n="11126"/><p>  Dante stared across the table, her cheeks shaking. Mr Casey 
                        <lb n="11127"/>struggled up from his chair and bent across the table towards 
                        <lb n="11128"/>her, scraping the air from before his eyes with one hand as 
                        <lb n="11129"/>though he were tearing aside a cobweb.

                    <lb n="11134"/><p>  Uncle Charles and Mr Dedalus pulled Mr Casey back into 
                        <lb n="11135"/>his chair again, talking to him from both sides reasonably. He 
                        <lb n="11136"/>stared before him out of his dark flaming eyes, repeating:

                    <lb n="11138"/><p>  Dante shoved her chair violently aside and left the table,

                        <lb n="11140"/>and came to rest against the foot of an easychair. Mrs Dedalus 
                        <lb n="11141"/>rose quickly and followed her towards the door. At the door 
                        <lb n="11142"/>Dante turned round violently and shouted down the room, her 
                        <lb n="11143"/>cheeks flushed and quivering with rage:

                        <lb n="11174"/><said who="Wells">―You know the altar wine they keep in the press in the sac-

                    <lb n="11179"/><p>  And the fellow who had spoken first said: 
                        <lb n="11180"/><said who="a fellow">―Yes, that's what I heard too from the fellow in the higher 
                            <lb n="11181"/>line. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11182"/><p>  The fellows were all silent. Stephen stood among them, 
                        <lb n="11183"/>afraid to speak, listening. A faint sickness of awe made him feel 
                        <lb n="11184"/>weak. How could they have done that? He thought of the dark 
                        <lb n="11185"/>silent sacristy. There were dark wooden presses there where the 
                        <lb n="11186"/>crimped surplices lay quietly folded. It was not the chapel but 
                        <lb n="11187"/>still you had to speak under your breath. It was a holy place. 
                        <lb n="11188"/>He remembered the summer evening he had been there to be 
                        <lb n="11189"/>dressed as <seg type="neologism">boatbearer</seg>, the evening of the procession to the little 
                        <lb n="11190"/>altar in the wood. A strange and holy place. The boy that held 
                        <lb n="11191"/>the censer had swung it gently to and fro near the door with the 
                        <lb n="11192"/>silvery cap lifted by the middle chain to keep the coals lighting. 
                        <lb n="11193"/>That was called charcoal: and it had burned quietly as the 
                        <lb n="11194"/>fellow had swung it gently and had given off a weak sour smell. 
                        <lb n="11195"/>And then when all were vested he had stood holding out the 
                        <lb n="11196"/>boat to the rector and the rector had put a spoonful of incense 
                        <lb n="11197"/>in  and it had hissed on the red coals. </p>
                    <lb n="11198"/><p>  The fellows were talking together in little groups here and 
                        <lb n="11199"/>there on the playground. The fellows seemed to him to have 
                        <lb n="11200"/>grown smaller: that was because a sprinter had knocked him 
                        <lb n="11201"/>down the day before, a fellow out of second of grammar. He 
                        <lb n="11202"/>had been thrown by the fellow's machine lightly on the cinder- 
                        <lb n="11203"/>path and his spectacles had been broken in three pieces and 
                        <lb n="11204"/>some of the grit of the cinders had gone into his mouth. </p>
                    <lb n="11205"/><p>  That was why the fellows seemed to him smaller and farther 
                        <lb n="11206"/>away and the goalposts so thin and far and the soft grey sky so 
                        <lb n="11207"/>high up. But there was no play on the football grounds for 
                        <lb n="11208"/>cricket was coming: and some said that Barnes would be the 
                        <lb n="11209"/>prof and some said it would be Flowers. And all over the play- 
                        <lb n="11210"/>playgrounds they were playing rounders and bowling twisters and 
                        <lb n="11211"/>lobs. And from here and from there came the sounds of the 
                        <lb n="11212"/><seg type="neologism">cricket bats</seg> through the soft grey air. They said: pick, pack, 
                        <lb n="11213"/>pock, puck: like drops of water in a fountain slowly falling in 
                        <lb n="11214"/>the brimming bowl. </p>
                    <lb n="11215"/><p>  Athy, who had been silent, said quietly: 
                        <lb n="11216"/><said who="Athy">―You are all wrong. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11217"/><p>  All turned towards him eagerly. 
                        <lb n="11218"/><said who="a fellow">―Why?  </said>
                        <lb n="11219"/><said who="a fellow">―Do you know?  </said>
                        <lb n="11220"/><said who="a fellow">―Who told you?  </said>
                        <lb n="11221"/><said who="a fellow">―Tell us, Athy. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11222"/><p>  Athy pointed across the playground to where Simon 
                        <lb n="11223"/>Moonan was walking by himself kicking a stone before him. </p>
                    <p><said who="Athy">―Ask him,</said> he said. <lb n="11224"></lb></p>
                    <lb n="11225"/><p>  The fellows looked there and then said: 
                        <lb n="11226"/><said who="a fellow">―Why him?  </said>
                        <lb n="11227"/><said who="a fellow">―Is he in it?  </said>
                        <lb n="11228"/><said who="a fellow">―Tell us, Athy. Go on. You might if you know. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11229"/><p>  Athy lowered his voice and said: 
                        <lb n="11230"/><said who="Athy">―Do you know why those fellows scut? I will tell you but you 
                            <lb n="11231"/>must not let on you know. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11232"/><p>  He paused for a moment and then said mysteriously: 
                        <lb n="11233"/><said who="Athy">―They were caught with Simon Moonan and Tusker Boyle in 
                            <lb n="11234"/>the square one night. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11235"/><p>  The fellows looked at him and asked: 
                        <lb n="11236"/><said who="a fellow">―Caught?  </said>
                        <lb n="11237"/><said who="a fellow">―What doing? </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11238"/><p>  Athy said: 
                        <lb n="11239"/><said who="Athy">―Smugging. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11240"/><p>  All the fellows were silent: and Athy said: 
                        <lb n="11241"/><said who="Athy">―And that's why. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11242"/><p>  Stephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all 
                        <lb n="11243"/>looking across the playground. He wanted to ask somebody 
                        <lb n="11244"/>about it. What did that mean about the smugging in the 
                        <lb n="11245"/>square? Why did the five fellows out of the higher line run 
                        <lb n="11246"/>away for that? It was a joke, he thought. Simon Moonan had 
                        <lb n="11247"/>nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of creamy 
                        <lb n="11248"/>sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down 
                        <lb n="11249"/>to him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he 
                        <lb n="11250"/>was at the door. It was the night of the match against the 
                        <lb n="11251"/>Bective Rangers and the ball was made just like a red and green 
                        <lb n="11252"/>apple only it opened and it was full of the creamy sweets. And 
                        <lb n="11253"/>one day Boyle had said that an elephant had two tuskers in- 
                        <lb n="11254"/>instead of two tusks and that was why he was called Tusker 
                        <lb n="11255"/>Boyle but some fellows called him Lady Boyle because he was 
                        <lb n="11256"/>always at his nails, paring them. </p>
                    <lb n="11257"/><p>  Eileen had long thin cool white hands too because she was a 
                        <lb n="11258"/>girl. They were like ivory; only soft. That was the meaning of 
                        <lb n="11259"/><emph>Tower of Ivory</emph> but protestants could not understand it and 
                        <lb n="11260"/>made fun of it. One day he had stood beside her looking into 
                        <lb n="11261"/>the hotel grounds. A waiter was running up a trail of bunting 
                        <lb n="11262"/>on the flagstaff and a fox terrier was scampering to and fro on 
                        <lb n="11263"/>the sunny lawn. She had put her hand into his pocket where his 
                        <lb n="11264"/>hand was and he had felt how cool and thin and soft her hand 
                        <lb n="11265"/>was. She had said that pockets were funny things to have: and 
                        <lb n="11266"/>then all of a sudden she had broken away and had run laughing 
                        <lb n="11267"/>down the sloping curve of the path. Her fair hair had streamed 
                        <lb n="11268"/>out behind her like gold in the sun. <emph>Tower of Ivory. House of 
                            <lb n="11269"/>Gold.</emph> By thinking about things you could understand them. </p>
                    <lb n="11270"/><p>  But why in the square? You went there when you wanted to 
                        <lb n="11271"/>do something. It was all thick slabs of slate and water trickled 
                        <lb n="11272"/>all day out of tiny pinholes and there was a queer smell of stale 
                        <lb n="11273"/>water there. And behind the door of one of the  closets there 
                        <lb n="11274"/>was a drawing in red pencil of a bearded man in a Roman dress 
                        <lb n="11275"/>with a brick in each hand and underneath was the name of the 
                        <lb n="11276"/>drawing: </p>
                    <lb n="11277"/><p>  <l><emph>Balbus was building a wall.</emph> </l>  </p>
                    <lb n="11278"/><p>  Some fellow had drawn it there for a cod. It had a funny 
                        <lb n="11279"/>face but it was very like a man with a beard. And on the wall of 
                        <lb n="11280"/>another closet there was written in backhand  in beautiful writ- 
                        <lb n="11281"/>ing: </p>
                    <lb n="11282"/><p>  <l>Julius Caesar wrote The Calico Belly. </l>  </p>
                    <lb n="11283"/><p>  Perhaps that was why they were there  because it was a place 
                        <lb n="11284"/>where some fellows wrote things for cod. But all the same it 
                        <lb n="11285"/>was queer what Athy said and the way he said it. It was not a 
                        <lb n="11286"/>cod because they had run away. He looked with the others in 
                        <lb n="11287"/>silence across the playground and began to feel afraid. </p>

                    <lb n="11329"/><p>  The fellows laughed; but he felt that they were a little afraid. 
                        <lb n="11330"/>In the silence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket bats from 
                        <lb n="11331"/>here and from there: pock. That was a sound to hear but if you 
                        <lb n="11332"/>were hit then you would feel a pain. The pandybat made a 
                        <lb n="11333"/>sound too but not like that. The fellows said it was made of 
                        <lb n="11334"/>whalebone and leather with lead inside: and he wondered what 
                        <lb n="11335"/>was the pain like. There were different kinds of pains  for all the 
                        <lb n="11336"/>different kinds of sounds. A long thin cane would have a high 
                        <lb n="11337"/>whistling sound and he wondered what was that pain like. It 
                        <lb n="11338"/>made him shivery to think of it and cold: and what Athy said 
                        <lb n="11339"/>too. But what was there to laugh at in it? It made him shivery: 
                        <lb n="11340"/>but that was because you always felt like a shiver when you let 
                        <lb n="11341"/>down your trousers. It was the same in the bath when you 
                        <lb n="11342"/>undressed yourself. He wondered who had to let them down, 
                        <lb n="11343"/>the master or the boy himself. O how could they laugh about it 
                        <lb n="11344"/>that way? </p>
                    <lb n="11345"/><p>  He looked at Athy's <seg type="neologism">rolledup</seg> sleeves and knuckly inky 
                        <lb n="11346"/>hands. He had rolled up his sleeves to show how Mr Gleeson 
                        <lb n="11347"/>would roll up his sleeves. But Mr Gleeson had round shiny 
                        <lb n="11348"/>cuffs and clean white wrists and fattish white hands and the 
                        <lb n="11349"/>nails of them were long and pointed. Perhaps he pared them 
                        <lb n="11350"/>too like Lady Boyle. But they were terribly long and pointed 
                        <lb n="11351"/>nails. So long and cruel they were though the white fattish 
                        <lb n="11352"/>hands were not cruel but gentle. And though he trembled with 
                        <lb n="11353"/>cold and fright to think of the cruel long nails and of the high 
                        <lb n="11354"/>whistling sound of the cane and of the chill you felt at the end 
                        <lb n="11355"/>of your shirt when you undressed yourself yet he felt a feeling 
                        <lb n="11356"/>of queer quiet pleasure inside him to think of the white fattish 
                        <lb n="11357"/>hands, clean and strong  and gentle. And he thought of what 
                        <lb n="11358"/>Cecil Thunder had said; that Mr Gleeson would not flog Cor- 
                        <lb n="11359"/>Corrigan hard. And Fleming had said he would not because it was 
                        <lb n="11360"/>best of his play not to. But that was not why. </p>
                    <lb n="11361"/><p>  A voice from far out on the playgrounds cried: 
                        <lb n="11362"/><said who="a fellow">―All in! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11363"/><p>  And other voices cried: 
                        <lb n="11364"/><said who="other voices">―All in! All in! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11365"/><p>  During the writing lesson he sat with his arms folded, listen- 
                        <lb n="11366"/>ing to the slow scraping of the pens. Mr Harford went to and 
                        <lb n="11367"/>fro making little signs in red pencil and sometimes sitting 
                        <lb n="11368"/>beside the boy to show him how to hold the pen. He had tried 
                        <lb n="11369"/>to spell out the headline for himself though he knew already 
                        <lb n="11370"/>what it was for it was the last in the book. <emph>Zeal without 
                            <lb n="11371"/>prudence is like a ship adrift.</emph> But the lines of the letters were 
                        <lb n="11372"/>like fine invisible threads and it was only by closing his right 
                        <lb n="11373"/>eye tight tight and staring out of the left eye that he could make 
                        <lb n="11374"/>out the full curves of the capital. </p>
                    <lb n="11375"/><p>  But Mr Harford was very decent and never got into a wax. 
                        <lb n="11376"/>All the other masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were 
                        <lb n="11377"/>they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did? Wells had 
                        <lb n="11378"/>said that they had drunk some of the altar wine out of the press 
                        <lb n="11379"/>in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had done it 
                        <lb n="11380"/>by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a monstrance to run away 
                        <lb n="11381"/>with it and sell it somewhere. That must have been a terrible 
                        <lb n="11382"/>sin, to go in  quietly there at night, to open the dark press and 
                        <lb n="11383"/>steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put on the 
                        <lb n="11384"/>altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while 
                        <lb n="11385"/>the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung 
                        <lb n="11386"/>the censer and Dominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in 
                        <lb n="11387"/>the choir. But God was not in it of course when they stole it. 
                        <lb n="11388"/>But still it was a strange and a great sin even to touch it. He 
                        <lb n="11389"/>thought of it with deep awe; a terrible and strange sin: it 
                        <lb n="11390"/>thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens scraped 
                        <lb n="11391"/>lightly. But to drink the altar wine out of the press and be 
                        <lb n="11392"/>found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not terrible 
                        <lb n="11393"/>and strange. It only made you feel a little sickish on account 
                        <lb n="11394"/>of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he had 
                        <lb n="11395"/>made his first holy communion in  the chapel he had shut his 
                        <lb n="11396"/>eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little: and 
                        <lb n="11397"/>when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy com- 
                        <lb n="11398"/>communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the rector's breath 
                        <lb n="11399"/>after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful: wine. It 
                        <lb n="11400"/>made you think of dark purple because the grapes were dark 
                        <lb n="11401"/>purple that grew in Greece outside houses like white temples. 
                        <lb n="11402"/>But the faint smell off the rector's breath had made him feel 
                        <lb n="11403"/>a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion. The day 
                        <lb n="11404"/>of your first communion was the happiest day of your life. 
                        <lb n="11405"/>And once a lot of generals had asked Napoleon what was the 
                        <lb n="11406"/>happiest day of his life. They thought he would say the day 
                        <lb n="11407"/>he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor. 
                        <lb n="11408"/>But he said: 
                        <lb n="11409"/><said who="Napoleon">―Gentlemen, the happiest day of my life was the day on which 
                            <lb n="11410"/>I made my first holy communion. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11411"/><p>  Father Arnall came in and the Latin lesson began and he 
                        <lb n="11412"/>remained still, leaning on the desk with his arms folded. Father 
                        <lb n="11413"/>Arnall gave out the <seg type="neologism">themebooks</seg> and he said that they were 
                        <lb n="11414"/>scandalous and that they were all to be written out again with 
                        <lb n="11415"/>the corrections at once. But the worst of all was Fleming's 
                        <lb n="11416"/>theme because the pages were stuck together by a blot: and 
                        <lb n="11417"/>Father Arnall held it up by a corner and said it was an insult to 
                        <lb n="11418"/>any master to send him up such a theme. Then he asked Jack 
                        <lb n="11419"/>Lawton to decline the noun <emph>mare</emph> and Jack Lawton stopped at 
                        <lb n="11420"/>the ablative singular and could not go on with the plural. 
                        <lb n="11421"/><said who="Father Arnall">―You should be ashamed of yourself, said Father Arnall 
                            <lb n="11422"/>sternly. You, the leader of the class! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11423"/><p>  Then he asked the next boy and the next and the next. 
                        <lb n="11424"/>Nobody knew. Father Arnall became very quiet, more and 
                        <lb n="11425"/>more quiet as each boy tried to answer and could not. But his 
                        <lb n="11426"/>face was <seg type="neologism">blacklooking</seg> and his eyes were staring though his 
                        <lb n="11427"/>voice was so quiet. Then he asked Fleming and Fleming said 
                        <lb n="11428"/>that that word had no plural. Father Arnall suddenly shut the 
                        <lb n="11429"/>book and shouted at him: 
                        <lb n="11430"/><said who="Father Arnall">―Kneel out there in the middle of the class. You are one of the 
                            <lb n="11431"/>idlest boys I ever met. Copy out your themes again the rest of 
                            <lb n="11432"/>you. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11433"/><p>  Fleming moved heavily out of his place and knelt between 
                        <lb n="11434"/>the two last benches. The other boys bent over their theme- 
                        <lb n="11435"/>books and began to write. A silence filled the classroom and 
                        <lb n="11436"/>Stephen, glancing timidly at Father Arnall's dark face, saw that 
                        <lb n="11437"/>it was a little red from the wax he was in. </p>
                    <lb n="11438"/><p>  Was that a sin for Father Arnall to be in a wax or was he 
                        <lb n="11439"/>allowed to get into a wax when the boys were idle because that 
                        <lb n="11440"/>made them study better or was he only letting on to be in a 
                        <lb n="11441"/>wax? It was because he was allowed because a priest would 
                        <lb n="11442"/>know what a sin was and would not do it. But if he did it one 
                        <lb n="11443"/>time by mistake what would he do to go to confession? Perhaps 
                        <lb n="11444"/>he would go to confession to the minister. And if the minister 
                        <lb n="11445"/>did it he would go to the rector: and the rector to the provin- 
                        <lb n="11446"/>cial: and the provincial to the general of the jesuits. That was 
                        <lb n="11447"/>called the order: and he had heard his father say that they were 
                        <lb n="11448"/>all clever men. They could all have become <seg type="neologism">highup</seg> people in 
                        <lb n="11449"/>the world if they had not become jesuits. And he wondered 
                        <lb n="11450"/>what Father Arnall and Paddy Barrett would have become and 
                        <lb n="11451"/>what Mr McGlade and Mr Gleeson would have become if they 
                        <lb n="11452"/>had not become jesuits. It was hard to think what because you 
                        <lb n="11453"/>would have to think of them in a different way with different 
                        <lb n="11454"/>coloured coats and trousers and with beards and moustaches 
                        <lb n="11455"/>and different kinds of hats. </p>
                    <lb n="11456"/><p>  The door opened quietly and closed. A quick whisper ran 
                        <lb n="11457"/>through the class: the prefect of studies. There was an instant 
                        <lb n="11458"/>of dead silence and then the loud crack of a pandybat on the 
                        <lb n="11459"/>last desk. Stephen's heart leapt up in fear. 
                        <lb n="11460"/><said who="Father Dolan">―Any boys want flogging here, Father Arnall? cried the pre- 
                            <lb n="11461"/>fect of studies. Any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in this 
                            <lb n="11462"/>class? </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11463"/><p>  He came to the middle of the class and saw Fleming on his 
                        <lb n="11464"/>knees. 
                        <lb n="11465"/><said who="Father Dolan">―Hoho! he cried. Who is this boy? Why is he on his knees? 
                            <lb n="11466"/>What is your name, boy?  </said>
                        <lb n="11467"/><said who="Fleming">―Fleming, sir.  </said>
                        <lb n="11468"/><said who="Father Dolan">―Hoho, Fleming! An idler of course. I can see it in your eye. 
                            <lb n="11469"/>Why is he on his knees, Father Arnall?  </said>
                        <lb n="11470"/><said who="Father Arnall">―He wrote a bad Latin theme,</said> Father Arnall said, <said who="Father Arnall">and he 
                            <lb n="11471"/>missed all the questions in grammar.  </said>

                    <lb n="11474"/><p>  He banged his pandybat down on the desk and cried: 
                        <lb n="11475"/><said who="Father Dolan">―Up, Fleming! Up, my boy! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11476"/><p>  Fleming stood up slowly. 
                        <lb n="11477"/><said who="Father Dolan">―Hold out!</said> cried the prefect of studies.  </p>
                    <lb n="11478"/><p>  Fleming held out his hand. The pandybat came down on it 
                        <lb n="11479"/>with a loud smacking sound: one, two, three, four, five, six. 
                        <lb n="11480"/><said who="Father Dolan">―Other hand! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11481"/><p>  The pandybat came down again in six loud quick smacks. 
                        <lb n="11482"/><said who="Father Dolan">―Kneel down!</said> cried the prefect of studies. </p>
                    <lb n="11483"/><p>  Fleming knelt down squeezing his hands under his armpits, 
                        <lb n="11484"/>his face contorted with pain, but Stephen knew how hard his 
                        <lb n="11485"/>hands were because Fleming was always rubbing rosin into 
                        <lb n="11486"/>them. But perhaps he was in great pain for the noise of the 
                        <lb n="11487"/>pandies was terrible. Stephen's heart was beating and flutter- 
                        <lb n="11488"/>ing. 
                        <lb n="11489"/><said who="Father Dolan">―At your work, all of you!</said> shouted the prefect of studies. <said who="Father Dolan">We 
                            <lb n="11490"/>want no lazy idle loafers here, lazy idle little schemers. At your

                    <lb n="11493"/><p>  He poked one of the boys in the side with the pandybat, 
                        <lb n="11494"/>saying: 
                        <lb n="11495"/><said who="Father Dolan">―You, boy! When will Father Dolan be in again?  </said>
                        <lb n="11496"/><said who="Tom Furlong">―Tomorrow, sir, said Tom Furlong's voice.  </said>

                    <lb n="11500"/><p>  Stephen's heart jumped suddenly.

                    <lb n="11504"/><p>  He could not speak with fright.

                        <lb n="11506"/><said who="Father Arnall">―He broke his glasses,</said> said Father Arnall, <said who="Father Arnall">and I exempted him

                        <lb n="11509"/>the prefect of studies. 
                        <lb n="11510"/><said who="Stephen">―Dedalus, sir.  </said>
                        <lb n="11511"/><said who="Father Dolan">―Out here, Dedalus. Lazy little schemer. I see schemer in your

                    <lb n="11513"/><p>  Stephen stumbled into the middle of the class, blinded by 
                        <lb n="11514"/>fear and haste. 
                        <lb n="11515"/><said who="Father Dolan">―Where did you break your glasses?</said> repeated the prefect of 
                        <lb n="11516"/>studies. 
                        <lb n="11517"/><said who="Stephen">―The <seg type="neologism">cinderpath</seg>, sir.  </said>

                    <lb n="11520"/><p>  Stephen lifted his eyes in wonder and saw for a moment 
                        <lb n="11521"/>Father Dolan's <seg type="neologism">whitegrey</seg> not young face, his baldy <seg type="neologism">whitegrey</seg> 
                        <lb n="11522"/>head with fluff at the sides of it, the steel rims of his spectacles 
                        <lb n="11523"/>and his <seg type="neologism">nocoloured</seg> eyes looking through the glasses. Why did 
                        <lb n="11524"/>he say that he knew that trick? 
                        <lb n="11525"/><said who="Father Dolan">―Lazy idle little loafer!</said> cried the prefect of studies. <said who="Father Dolan">Broke my 
                            <lb n="11526"/>glasses! An old schoolboy trick! Out with your hand this mo- 
                            <lb n="11527"/>moment! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11528"/><p>  Stephen closed his eyes and held out in the air his trembling 
                        <lb n="11529"/>hand with the palm upwards. He felt the prefect of studies 
                        <lb n="11530"/>touch it for a moment at the fingers to straighten it and then 
                        <lb n="11531"/>the swish of the sleeve of the soutane as the pandybat was lifted 
                        <lb n="11532"/>to strike. A hot burning stinging tingling blow like the loud 
                        <lb n="11533"/>crack of a broken stick made his trembling hand crumple to- 
                        <lb n="11534"/>together like a leaf in the fire: and at the sound and the pain 
                        <lb n="11535"/>scalding tears were driven into his eyes. His whole body was 
                        <lb n="11536"/>shaking with fright, his arm was shaking and his crumpled 
                        <lb n="11537"/>burning livid hand shook like a loose leaf in the air. A cry 
                        <lb n="11538"/>sprang to his lips, a prayer to be let off. But though the tears 
                        <lb n="11539"/>scalded his eyes and his limbs quivered with pain and fright he 
                        <lb n="11540"/>held back the hot tears and the cry that scalded his throat. 
                        <lb n="11541"/><said who="Father Dolan">―Other hand!</said> shouted the prefect of studies.  </p>
                    <lb n="11542"/><p>  Stephen drew back his maimed and quivering right arm and 
                        <lb n="11543"/>held out his left hand. The soutane sleeve swished again as the 
                        <lb n="11544"/>pandybat was lifted and a loud crashing sound and a fierce 
                        <lb n="11545"/>maddening tingling burning pain made his hand shrink to- 
                        <lb n="11546"/>together with the palms and fingers in a livid quivering mass. The 
                        <lb n="11547"/>scalding water burst forth from his eyes and, burning with 
                        <lb n="11548"/>shame and agony and fear, he drew back his shaking arm in 
                        <lb n="11549"/>terror and burst out into a whine of pain. His body shook with 
                        <lb n="11550"/>a palsy of fright and in shame and rage he felt the scalding cry 
                        <lb n="11551"/>come from his throat and the scalding tears falling out of his 
                        <lb n="11552"/>eyes and down his flaming cheeks. 
                        <lb n="11553"/><said who="Father Dolan">―Kneel down! cried the prefect of studies. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11554"/><p>  Stephen knelt down quickly pressing his beaten hands to his 
                        <lb n="11555"/>sides. To think of them  beaten and swollen with pain all in a 
                        <lb n="11556"/>moment made him feel so sorry for them as if they were not his 
                        <lb n="11557"/>own but someone else's that he felt so sorry for. And as he 
                        <lb n="11558"/>knelt, calming the last sobs in his throat and feeling the burning 
                        <lb n="11559"/>tingling pain pressed in to his sides, he thought of the hands 
                        <lb n="11560"/>which he had held out in the air with the palms up and of the 
                        <lb n="11561"/>firm touch of the prefect of studies when he had steadied the 
                        <lb n="11562"/>shaking fingers and of the beaten swollen reddened mass of 
                        <lb n="11563"/>palm and fingers that shook helplessly  in the air. 
                        <lb n="11564"/><said who="Father Dolan">―Get at your work, all of you, cried the prefect of studies 
                            <lb n="11565"/>from the door. Father Dolan will be in every day to see if any 
                            <lb n="11566"/>boy, any lazy idle little loafer wants flogging. Every day. Every 
                            <lb n="11567"/>day. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11568"/><p>  The door closed behind him. </p>
                    <lb n="11569"/><p>  The hushed class continued to copy out the themes. Father 
                        <lb n="11570"/>Arnall rose from his seat and went among them, helping the 
                        <lb n="11571"/>boys with gentle words and telling them the mistakes they had 
                        <lb n="11572"/>made. His voice was very gentle and soft. Then he returned to 
                        <lb n="11573"/>his seat and said to Fleming and Stephen: 
                        <lb n="11574"/><said who="Father Arnall">―You may return to your places, you two. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11575"/><p>  Fleming and Stephen rose and, walking to their seats, sat 
                        <lb n="11576"/>down. Stephen, scarlet with shame, opened a book quickly 
                        <lb n="11577"/>with one weak hand and bent down upon it, his face close to 
                        <lb n="11578"/>the page. </p>
                    <lb n="11579"/><p>  It was unfair and cruel: because the doctor had told him not 
                        <lb n="11580"/>to read without glasses and he had written home to his father 
                        <lb n="11581"/>that morning to send him a new pair. And Father Arnall had 
                        <lb n="11582"/>said that he need not study till the new glasses came. Then to 
                        <lb n="11583"/>be called a schemer before the class and to be pandied when he 
                        <lb n="11584"/>always got the card for first or second and was the leader of the 
                        <lb n="11585"/>Yorkists! How could the prefect of studies know that it was a 
                        <lb n="11586"/>trick? He felt the touch of the prefect's fingers as they had 
                        <lb n="11587"/>steadied his hand and at first he had thought that he was going 
                        <lb n="11588"/>to shake hands with him because the fingers were soft and firm: 
                        <lb n="11589"/>but then in an instant he had heard the swish of the soutane 
                        <lb n="11590"/>sleeve and the crash. It was cruel and unfair to make him kneel 
                        <lb n="11591"/>in the middle of the class then: and Father Arnall had told them 
                        <lb n="11592"/>both that they might return to their places without making any 
                        <lb n="11593"/>difference between them. He listened to Father Arnall's low 
                        <lb n="11594"/>and gentle voice as he corrected the themes. Perhaps he was 
                        <lb n="11595"/>sorry now and wanted to be decent. But it was unfair and cruel. 
                        <lb n="11596"/>The prefect of studies was a priest but that was cruel and 
                        <lb n="11597"/>unfair. And his <seg type="neologism">whitegrey</seg> face and the <seg type="neologism">nocoloured</seg> eyes behind 
                        <lb n="11598"/>the <seg type="neologism">steelrimmed</seg> spectacles were cruel looking because he had 
                        <lb n="11599"/>steadied the hand first with his firm soft fingers and that was to 
                        <lb n="11600"/>hit it better and louder.

                    <lb n="11623"/><p>  And there were some fellows out of second of grammar lis-

                            <lb n="11626"/>been wrongly punished. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11627"/><p>  It was wrong; it was unfair and cruel: and, as he sat in the 
                        <lb n="11628"/>refectory, he suffered time after time in memory the same hu- 
                        <lb n="11629"/>humiliation until he began to wonder whether it might not really 
                        <lb n="11630"/>be that there was something in his face which made him look 
                        <lb n="11631"/>like a schemer and he wished he had a little mirror to see. But 
                        <lb n="11632"/>there could not be; and it was unjust and cruel and unfair. </p>
                    <lb n="11633"/><p>  He could not eat the blackish fish fritters they got on 
                        <lb n="11634"/>Wednesdays in lent and one of his potatoes had the mark of the 
                        <lb n="11635"/>spade in it. Yes, he would do what the fellows had told him. He 
                        <lb n="11636"/>would go up and tell the rector that he had been wrongly 
                        <lb n="11637"/>punished. A thing like that had been done before by somebody 
                        <lb n="11638"/>in history, by some great person whose head was in the books 
                        <lb n="11639"/>of history. And the rector would declare that he had been 
                        <lb n="11640"/>wrongly punished because the senate and the Roman people 
                        <lb n="11641"/>always declared that the man who did that had been wrongly 
                        <lb n="11642"/>punished. Those were the great men whose names were in 
                        <lb n="11643"/>Richmal Magnall's Questions. History was all about those men 
                        <lb n="11644"/>and what they did and that was what Peter Parley's Tales about 
                        <lb n="11645"/>Greece and Rome were all about. Peter Parley himself was on 
                        <lb n="11646"/>the first page in a picture. There was a road over a heath with 
                        <lb n="11647"/>grass at the side and little bushes: and Peter Parley had a broad 
                        <lb n="11648"/>hat like a protestant minister and a big stick and he was walk- 
                        <lb n="11649"/>ing fast along the road to <place><location><geo>39.074208 21.824312</geo></location><placeName>Greece</placeName></place> and 
                        <place><location><geo>41.902783 12.496366</geo></location><placeName>Rome</placeName></place>.</p>
                    <lb n="11650"/><p>  It was easy what he had to do. All he had to do  was when 
                        <lb n="11651"/>the dinner was over and he came out in his turn to go on 
                        <lb n="11652"/>walking but not out to the corridor but up the staircase on the 
                        <lb n="11653"/>right that led to the castle. He had nothing to do but that: to 
                        <lb n="11654"/>turn to the right and walk fast up the staircase and in half a 
                        <lb n="11655"/>minute he would be in the low dark narrow corridor that led 
                        <lb n="11656"/>through the castle to the rector's room. And every fellow had 
                        <lb n="11657"/>said that it was unfair, even the fellow out of second of gram- 
                        <lb n="11658"/>mar who had said that about the senate and the Roman people. </p>
                    <lb n="11659"/><p>  What would happen? He heard the fellows of the higher line 
                        <lb n="11660"/>stand up at the top of the refectory and heard their steps as 
                        <lb n="11661"/>they came down the matting: Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee 
                        <lb n="11662"/>and the Spaniard and the Portuguese and the fifth was big 
                        <lb n="11663"/>Corrigan who was going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. That 
                        <lb n="11664"/>was why the prefect of studies had called him a schemer and 
                        <lb n="11665"/>pandied him for nothing: and, straining his weak eyes, tired 
                        <lb n="11666"/>with the tears, he watched big Corrigan's broad shoulders and 
                        <lb n="11667"/>big hanging black head passing in the file. But he had done 
                        <lb n="11668"/>something and besides Mr Gleeson would not flog him hard: 
                        <lb n="11669"/>and he remembered how big Corrigan looked in the bath. He 
                        <lb n="11670"/>had skin the same colour as the <seg type="neologism">turfcoloured</seg> bogwater in the 
                        <lb n="11671"/>shallow end of the bath and when he walked along the side his 
                        <lb n="11672"/>feet slapped loudly on the wet tiles and at every step his thighs 
                        <lb n="11673"/>shook a little because he was fat. </p>
                    <lb n="11674"/><p>  The refectory was half empty and the fellows were still 
                        <lb n="11675"/>passing out in file. He could go up the staircase because there 
                        <lb n="11676"/>was never a priest or a prefect outside the refectory door. But 
                        <lb n="11677"/>he could not go. The rector would side with the prefect of 
                        <lb n="11678"/>studies and think it was a schoolboy trick and then the prefect 
                        <lb n="11679"/>of studies would come in every day the same only it would be 
                        <lb n="11680"/>worse because he would be dreadfully waxy at any fellow 
                        <lb n="11681"/>going up to the rector about him. The fellows had told him to 
                        <lb n="11682"/>go but they would not go themselves. They had forgotten all 
                        <lb n="11683"/>about it. No, it was best to forget all about it: and perhaps the 
                        <lb n="11684"/>prefect of studies had only said he would come in. No, it was 
                        <lb n="11685"/>best to hide out of the way because when you were small and 
                        <lb n="11686"/>young you could often escape that way. </p>
                    <lb n="11687"/><p>  The fellows at his table stood up. He stood up and passed 
                        <lb n="11688"/>out among them in the file. He had to decide. He was coming 
                        <lb n="11689"/>near the door. If he went on with the fellows he could never go 
                        <lb n="11690"/>up to the rector because he could not leave the playground for 
                        <lb n="11691"/>that. And if he went and was pandied all the same all the 
                        <lb n="11692"/>fellows would make fun and talk about young Dedalus going 
                        <lb n="11693"/>up to the rector to tell on the prefect of studies. </p>
                    <lb n="11694"/><p>  He was walking down along the matting and he saw the 
                        <lb n="11695"/>door before him. It was impossible: he could not. He thought 
                        <lb n="11696"/>of the baldy head of the prefect of studies with the cruel no- 
                        <lb n="11697"/><seg type="neologism">nocoloured</seg> eyes looking at him and he heard the voice of the 
                        <lb n="11698"/>prefect of studies asking him twice what his name was. Why 
                        <lb n="11699"/>could he not remember the name when he was told the first 
                        <lb n="11700"/>time? Was he not listening the first time or was it to make fun 
                        <lb n="11701"/>out of the name? The great men in the history had names like 
                        <lb n="11702"/>that and nobody made fun of them. It was his own name that 
                        <lb n="11703"/>he should have made fun of if he wanted to make fun. Dolan: it 
                        <lb n="11704"/>was like the name of a woman that washed clothes. </p>
                    <lb n="11705"/><p>  He had reached the door and, turning quickly  to the right, 
                        <lb n="11706"/>walked up the stairs: and, before he could make up his mind to 
                        <lb n="11707"/>come back, he had entered the low dark narrow corridor that 
                        <lb n="11708"/>led to the castle. And as he crossed the threshold of the door of 
                        <lb n="11709"/>the corridor  he saw, without turning his head to look, that all 
                        <lb n="11710"/>the fellows were looking after him as they went filing by. </p>
                    <lb n="11711"/><p>  He passed along the narrow dark corridor, passing little 
                        <lb n="11712"/>doors that were the doors of the rooms of the community. He 
                        <lb n="11713"/>peered in front of him and right and left through the gloom and 
                        <lb n="11714"/>thought that those must be portraits. It was dark and silent and 
                        <lb n="11715"/>his eyes were weak and tired with tears so that he could not 
                        <lb n="11716"/>see. But he thought they were the portraits of the saints and 
                        <lb n="11717"/>great men of the order who were looking down on him silently 
                        <lb n="11718"/>as he passed: saint Ignatius Loyola holding an open book and 
                        <lb n="11719"/>pointing to the words <seg xml:lang="la">Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam</seg> in it, saint 
                        <lb n="11720"/>Francis Xavier pointing to his chest, Lorenzo Ricci with his 
                        <lb n="11721"/>berretta on his head like one of the prefects of the lines, the 
                        <lb n="11722"/>three patrons of holy youth, saint Stanislaus Kostka, saint 
                        <lb n="11723"/>Aloysius Gonzaga and blessed John Berchmans, all with young 
                        <lb n="11724"/>faces because they died when they were young, and Father 
                        <lb n="11725"/>Peter Kenny sitting in a chair wrapped in a big cloak. </p>
                    <lb n="11726"/><p>  He came out on the landing above the entrance hall and 
                        <lb n="11727"/>looked about him. That was where Hamilton Rowan had 
                        <lb n="11728"/>passed and the marks of the soldiers' slugs were there. And it 
                        <lb n="11729"/>was there that the old servants had seen the ghost in the white 
                        <lb n="11730"/>cloak of a marshal. </p>
                    <lb n="11731"/><p>  An old servant was sweeping at the end of the landing. He 
                        <lb n="11732"/>asked him where was the rector's room and the old servant 
                        <lb n="11733"/>pointed to the door at the far end and looked after him as he 
                        <lb n="11734"/>went on to it and knocked. </p>
                    <lb n="11735"/><p>  There was no answer. He knocked again more loudly and 
                        <lb n="11736"/>his heart jumped when he heard a muffled voice say: 
                        <lb n="11737"/><said who="the rector">―Come in! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11738"/><p>  He turned the handle and opened the door and fumbled for 
                        <lb n="11739"/>the handle of the green baize door inside. He found it and 
                        <lb n="11740"/>pushed it open and went in. </p>
                    <lb n="11741"/><p>  He saw the rector sitting at a desk writing. There was a skull 
                        <lb n="11742"/>on the desk and a strange solemn smell in the room like the old 
                        <lb n="11743"/>leather of chairs. </p>
                    <lb n="11744"/><p>  His heart was beating fast on account of the solemn place he 
                        <lb n="11745"/>was in and the silence of the room:  and he looked at the skull 
                        <lb n="11746"/>and at the rector's <seg type="neologism">kindlooking</seg> face. 
                        <lb n="11747"/><said who="the rector">―Well, my little man, said the rector. What is it? </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11748"/><p>  Stephen swallowed down the thing in his throat and said: 
                        <lb n="11749"/><said who="Stephen">―I broke my glasses, sir. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11750"/><p>  The rector opened his mouth and said: 
                        <lb n="11751"/><said who="the rector">―O! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11752"/><p>  Then he smiled and said: 
                        <lb n="11753"/><said who="the rector">―Well, if we broke our glasses we must write home for a new 
                            <lb n="11754"/>pair.  </said>
                        <lb n="11755"/><said who="Stephen">―I wrote home, sir,</said> said Stephen, <said who="Stephen">and Father Arnall said I am 
                            <lb n="11756"/>not to study till they come.  </said>
                        <lb n="11757"/><said who="the rector">―Quite right!</said> said the rector.  </p>
                    <lb n="11758"/><p>  Stephen swallowed down the thing again  and tried to keep 
                        <lb n="11759"/>his legs and his voice from shaking. 
                        <lb n="11760"/><said who="Stephen">―But, sir ....  </said>
                        <lb n="11761"/><said who="the rector">―Yes?  </said>
                        <lb n="11762"/><said who="Stephen">―Father Dolan came in today and pandied me because I was

                    <lb n="11764"/><p>  The rector looked at him in silence and he could feel the 
                        <lb n="11765"/>blood rising to his face and the tears about to rise to his eyes. </p>
                    <lb n="11766"/><p>  The rector said: 
                        <lb n="11767"/><said who="the rector">―Your name is Dedalus, isn't it?  </said>
                        <lb n="11768"/><said who="Stephen">―Yes, sir.  </said>
                        <lb n="11769"/><said who="the rector">―And where did you break your glasses?  </said>
                        <lb n="11770"/><said who="Stephen">―On the <seg type="neologism">cinderpath</seg>, sir. A fellow was coming out of the 
                            <lb n="11771"/>bicycle house and I fell and they got broken. I don't know the 
                            <lb n="11772"/>fellow's name. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11773"/><p>  The rector looked at him again in silence. Then he smiled 
                        <lb n="11774"/>and said: 
                        <lb n="11775"/><said who="the rector">―O, well, it was a mistake. I am sure Father Dolan did not 
                            <lb n="11776"/>know.  </said>
                        <lb n="11777"/><said who="Stephen">―But I told him I broke them, sir, and he pandied me.  </said>
                        <lb n="11778"/><said who="the rector">―Did you tell him that you had written home for a new pair? 
                            <lb n="11779"/>the rector asked.  </said>
                        <lb n="11780"/><said who="Stephen">―No, sir.  </said>
                        <lb n="11781"/><said who="the rector">―O well then,</said> said the rector, <said who="the rector">Father Dolan did not under- 
                            <lb n="11782"/>stand. You can say that I excuse you from your lessons for a

                    <lb n="11784"/><p>  Stephen said quickly for fear his trembling would prevent 
                        <lb n="11785"/>him: 
                        <lb n="11786"/><said who="Stephen">―Yes, sir, but Father Dolan said he will come in tomorrow to 
                            <lb n="11787"/>pandy me again for it.  </said>
                        <lb n="11788"/><said who="the rector">―Very well,</said> the rector said. <said who="the rector">It is a mistake and I shall speak to 
                            <lb n="11789"/>Father Dolan myself. Will that do now? </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11790"/><p>  Stephen felt the tears wetting his eyes and murmured: 
                        <lb n="11791"/><said who="Stephen">―O yes, sir, thanks. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11792"/><p>  The rector held his hand across the side of the desk where 
                        <lb n="11793"/>the skull was and Stephen, placing his hand in it for a moment, 
                        <lb n="11794"/>felt a cool moist palm. 
                        <lb n="11795"/><said who="the rector">―Good day now, said the rector, withdrawing his hand and 
                            <lb n="11796"/>bowing.  </said>
                        <lb n="11797"/><said who="Stephen">―Good day, sir, said Stephen. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11798"/><p>  He bowed and walked quietly out of the room, closing the 
                        <lb n="11799"/>doors carefully and slowly. </p>
                    <lb n="11800"/><p>  But when he had passed the old servant on the landing and 
                        <lb n="11801"/>was again in the low narrow dark corridor he began to walk 
                        <lb n="11802"/>faster and faster. Faster and faster he hurried on through the 
                        <lb n="11803"/>gloom, excitedly. He bumped his elbow against the door at the 
                        <lb n="11804"/>end and, hurrying down the staircase, walked quickly through 
                        <lb n="11805"/>the two corridors and out into the air. </p>
                    <lb n="11806"/><p>  He could hear the cries of the fellows on the playgrounds. 
                        <lb n="11807"/>He broke into a run and, running quicker and quicker, ran 
                        <lb n="11808"/>across the <seg type="neologism">cinderpath</seg> and reached the third line playground, 
                        <lb n="11809"/>panting. </p>
                    <lb n="11810"/><p>  The fellows had seen him running. They closed round him in 
                        <lb n="11811"/>a ring, pushing one against another to hear. 
                        <lb n="11812"/><said who="the fellows">―Tell us! Tell us!  </said>
                        <lb n="11813"/><said who="the fellows">―What did he say?  </said>
                        <lb n="11814"/><said who="the fellows">―Did you go in?  </said>
                        <lb n="11815"/><said who="the fellows">―What did he say?  </said>
                        <lb n="11816"/><said who="the fellows">―Tell us! Tell us! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11817"/><p>  He told them what he had said and what the rector had said 
                        <lb n="11818"/>and, when he had told them, all the fellows flung their caps 
                        <lb n="11819"/>spinning up into the air and cried: 
                        <lb n="11820"/><said who="the fellows">―Hurroo! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11821"/><p>  They caught their caps and sent them up again spinning 
                        <lb n="11822"/><seg type="neologism">skyhigh</seg> and cried again: 
                        <lb n="11823"/><said who="the fellows">―Hurroo! Hurroo! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11824"/><p>  They made a cradle of their locked hands and hoisted him 
                        <lb n="11825"/>up among them and carried him along till he struggled to get 
                        <lb n="11826"/>free. And when he had escaped from them they broke away in 
                        <lb n="11827"/>all directions, flinging their caps again into the air and whis- 
                        <lb n="11828"/>tling as they went spinning up and crying: 
                        <lb n="11829"/><said who="the fellows">―Hurroo! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="11830"/><p>  And they gave three groans for Baldyhead Dolan and three 
                        <lb n="11831"/>cheers for Conmee and they said he was the decentest rector 
                        <lb n="11832"/>that was ever in Clongowes. </p>
                    <lb n="11833"/><p>  The cheers died away in the soft grey air. He was alone. He 
                        <lb n="11834"/>was happy and free: but he would not be anyway proud with 
                        <lb n="11835"/>Father Dolan. He would be very quiet and obedient: and he 
                        <lb n="11836"/>wished that he could do something kind for him to show him 
                        <lb n="11837"/>that he was not proud. </p>
                    <lb n="11838"/><p>  The air was soft and grey and mild and evening was coming. 
                        <lb n="11839"/>There was the smell of evening in the air, the smell of the fields 
                        <lb n="11840"/>in the country where they digged up turnips to peel them and 
                        <lb n="11841"/>eat them when they went out for a walk to <place><location><geo>53.257926 -6.585225</geo></location><placeName>Major Barton's</placeName></place>, the 
                        <lb n="11842"/>smell there was in the little wood beyond the pavilion where 
                        <lb n="11843"/>the gallnuts were. </p>
                    <lb n="11844"/><p>  The fellows were practising long shies and bowling lobs and 
                        <lb n="11845"/>slow twisters. In the soft grey silence he could hear the bump of 
                        <lb n="11846"/>the balls: and from here and from there through the quiet air 
                        <lb n="11847"/>the sound of the cricket bats: pick, pack, pock, puck: like drops 
                        <lb n="11848"/>of water in a fountain falling softly in the brimming bowl. </p>

                        <lb n="20002"/>spoken nephew suggested to him to enjoy his morning smoke 
                        <lb n="20003"/>in a little outhouse at the end of the garden. 
                        <lb n="20004"/><said who="Uncle Charles">―Very good, Simon. All serene, Simon, said the old man tran- 
                            <lb n="20005"/>quilly. Anywhere you like. The outhouse will do me nicely: it 
                            <lb n="20006"/>will be more salubrious. </said>
                        <lb n="20007"/><said who="Simon Dedalus">―Damn me, said Mr Dedalus frankly, if I know how you can 
                            <lb n="20008"/>smoke such villainous awful tobacco. It's like gunpowder, by 
                            <lb n="20009"/>God. </said>
                        <lb n="20010"/><said who="Uncle Charles">―It's very nice, Simon, replied the old man. Very cool and 
                            <lb n="20011"/>mollifying.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="20012"/><p>  Every morning, therefore, uncle Charles repaired to his out- 
                        <lb n="20013"/>house but not before he had creased and brushed scrupulously 
                        <lb n="20014"/>his back hair and brushed and put on his tall hat. While he 
                        <lb n="20015"/>smoked the brim of his tall hat and the bowl of his pipe were 
                        <lb n="20016"/>just visible beyond the jambs of the outhouse door. His arbour, 
                        <lb n="20017"/>as he called the reeking outhouse which he shared with the cat 
                        <lb n="20018"/>and the garden tools, served him also as a soundingbox: and 
                        <lb n="20019"/>every morning he hummed contentedly one of his favourite 
                        <lb n="20020"/>songs: <emph>O, twine me a bower</emph> or <emph>Blue eyes and golden hair</emph> or 
                        <lb n="20021"/><emph>The Groves of Blarney</emph> while the grey and blue coils of smoke 
                        <lb n="20022"/>rose slowly from his pipe and vanished in the pure air. </p>
                    <lb n="20023"/><p>  During the first part of the summer in Blackrock uncle 
                        <lb n="20024"/>Charles was Stephen's constant companion. Uncle Charles was 
                        <lb n="20025"/>a hale old man with a well tanned skin, rugged features and 
                        <lb n="20026"/>white side whiskers. On week days he did messages between 
                        <lb n="20027"/>the house in <place><location><geo>53.293248 -6.180109</geo></location><placeName>Carysfort Avenue</placeName></place> and those shops in the main 
                        <lb n="20028"/>street of the town with which the family dealt. Stephen was 
                        <lb n="20029"/>glad to go with him on these errands for uncle Charles helped 
                        <lb n="20030"/>him very liberally to handfuls of whatever was exposed in open 
                        <lb n="20031"/>boxes and barrels outside the counter. He would seize a hand- 
                        <lb n="20032"/>ful of grapes and sawdust or three or four American apples and 
                        <lb n="20033"/>thrust them generously into his grandnephew's hand while the 
                        <lb n="20034"/>shopman smiled uneasily; and on Stephen's feigning reluctance 
                        <lb n="20035"/>to take them, he would frown and say: 
                        <lb n="20036"/><said who="Uncle Charles">―Take them, sir. Do you hear me, sir? They're good for your 
                            <lb n="20037"/>bowels.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="20038"/><p>  When the order list had been booked the two would go on 
                        <lb n="20039"/>to the park where an old friend of Stephen's father, Mike 
                        <lb n="20040"/>Flynn, would be found seated on a bench, waiting for them. 
                        <lb n="20041"/>Then would begin Stephen's run round the park. Mike Flynn 
                        <lb n="20042"/>would stand at the gate near the railway station, watch in 
                        <lb n="20043"/>hand, while Stephen ran round the track in the style Mike 
                        <lb n="20044"/>Flynn favoured, his head high lifted, his knees well lifted and 
                        <lb n="20045"/>his hands held straight down by his sides. When the morning 
                        <lb n="20046"/>practice was over the trainer would make his comments and 
                        <lb n="20047"/>sometimes illustrate them by shuffling along for a yard or so 
                        <lb n="20048"/>comically in an old pair of blue canvas shoes. A small ring of 
                        <lb n="20049"/>wonderstruck children and nursemaids would gather to watch 
                        <lb n="20050"/>him and linger even when he and uncle Charles had sat down 
                        <lb n="20051"/>again and were talking athletics and politics. Though he had 
                        <lb n="20052"/>heard his father say that Mike Flynn had put some of the best 
                        <lb n="20053"/>runners of modern times through his hands Stephen often 
                        <lb n="20054"/>glanced with mistrust at his trainer's flabby stubblecovered 
                        <lb n="20055"/>face, as it bent over the long stained fingers through which he 
                        <lb n="20056"/>rolled his cigarette, and with pity at the mild lustreless blue 
                        <lb n="20057"/>eyes which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze 
                        <lb n="20058"/>vaguely into the bluer distance while the long swollen fingers 
                        <lb n="20059"/>ceased their rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back 
                        <lb n="20060"/>into the pouch. </p>
                    <lb n="20061"/><p>  On the way home uncle Charles would often pay a visit to 
                        <lb n="20062"/>the chapel and, as the font was above Stephen's reach, the old 
                        <lb n="20063"/>man would dip his hand and then sprinkle the water briskly 
                        <lb n="20064"/>about Stephen's clothes and on the floor of the porch. While he 
                        <lb n="20065"/>prayed he knelt on his red handkerchief and read above his 
                        <lb n="20066"/>breath from a thumbblackened prayerbook wherein catch- 
                        <lb n="20067"/>words were printed at the foot of every page. Stephen knelt at 
                        <lb n="20068"/>his side respecting, though he did not share, his piety. He often 
                        <lb n="20069"/>wondered what his granduncle prayed for so seriously. Perhaps 
                        <lb n="20070"/>he prayed for the souls in purgatory or for the grace of a happy 
                        <lb n="20071"/>death: or perhaps he prayed that God might send him back a 
                        <lb n="20072"/>part of the big fortune he had squandered in Cork. </p>
                    <lb n="20073"/><p>  On Sundays Stephen with his father and his granduncle took 
                        <lb n="20074"/>their constitutional. The old man was a nimble walker in spite 
                        <lb n="20075"/>of his corns and often ten or twelve miles of the road were 
                        <lb n="20076"/>covered. The little village of <place><location><geo>53.287857 -6.203573</geo></location><placeName>Stillorgan</placeName></place> was the parting of the 
                        <lb n="20077"/>ways. Either they went to the left towards the Dublin moun- 
                        <lb n="20078"/>tains or along the <place><location><geo>53.297702 -6.233964</geo></location><placeName>Goatstown road</placeName></place> and thence 
                        into <place><location><geo>53.289154 -6.243264</geo></location><placeName>Dundrum</placeName></place>,
                        <lb n="20079"/>coming home by  <place><location><geo>53.269979 -6.224923</geo></location><placeName>Sandyford</placeName></place>. Trudging along the road or 
                        <lb n="20080"/>standing in some grimy wayside publichouse his elders spoke 
                        <lb n="20081"/>constantly of the subjects nearest their hearts, of Irish politics, 
                        <lb n="20082"/>of Munster and of the legends of their own family, to all of 
                        <lb n="20083"/>which Stephen lent an avid ear. Words which he did not under- 
                        <lb n="20084"/>stand he said over and over to himself till he had learned them 
                        <lb n="20085"/>by heart: and through them he had glimpses of the real world 
                        <lb n="20086"/>about him. The hour when he too would take his part in the 
                        <lb n="20087"/>life of that world seemed drawing near and in secret he began 
                        <lb n="20088"/>to make ready for the great part which he felt awaited him the 
                        <lb n="20089"/>nature of which he only dimly apprehended. </p>
                    <lb n="20090"/><p>  His evenings were his own; and he pored over a ragged 
                        <lb n="20091"/>translation of <emph>The Count of Monte Cristo</emph>. The figure of that 
                        <lb n="20092"/>dark avenger stood forth in his mind for whatever he had heard 
                        <lb n="20093"/>or divined in childhood of the strange and terrible. At night he 
                        <lb n="20094"/>built up on the parlour table an image of the wonderful island 
                        <lb n="20095"/>cave out of transfers and paper flowers and coloured tissue 
                        <lb n="20096"/>paper and strips of the silver and golden paper in which choc- 
                        <lb n="20097"/>olate is wrapped. When he had broken up this scenery, weary 
                        <lb n="20098"/>of its tinsel, there would come to his mind the bright picture of 
                        <lb n="20099"/><place><location><geo>43.295207

                        <lb n="20101"/>whitewashed house in the garden of which grew many rose- 
                        <lb n="20102"/>bushes: and in this house, he told himself, another Mercedes 
                        <lb n="20103"/>lived. Both on the outward and on the homeward journey he 
                        <lb n="20104"/>measured distance by this landmark: and in his imagination he 
                        <lb n="20105"/>lived through a long train of adventures, marvellous as those in 
                        <lb n="20106"/>the book itself, towards the close of which there appeared an 
                        <lb n="20107"/>image of himself, grown older and sadder, standing in a 
                        <lb n="20108"/>moonlit garden with Mercedes who had so many years before 
                        <lb n="20109"/>slighted his love, and with a sadly proud gesture of refusal, 
                        <lb n="20110"/>saying: 
                        <lb n="20111"/><said who="Count of Monte Cristo">―Madam, I never eat muscatel grapes.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="20112"/><p>  He became the ally of a boy named Aubrey Mills and 
                        <lb n="20113"/>founded with him a gang of adventurers in the avenue. Aubrey 
                        <lb n="20114"/>carried a whistle dangling from his buttonhole and a bicycle 
                        <lb n="20115"/>lamp attached to his belt while the others had short sticks 
                        <lb n="20116"/>thrust daggerwise through theirs. Stephen, who had read of 
                        <lb n="20117"/>Napoleon's plain style of dress, chose to remain unadorned and 
                        <lb n="20118"/>thereby heightened for himself the pleasure of taking counsel 
                        <lb n="20119"/>with his lieutenant before giving orders. The gang made forays 
                        <lb n="20120"/>into the gardens of old maids or went down to the castle and 
                        <lb n="20121"/>fought a battle on the shaggy weedgrown rocks, coming home 
                        <lb n="20122"/>after it weary stragglers with the stale odours of the foreshore 
                        <lb n="20123"/>in their nostrils and the rank oils of the seawrack upon their 
                        <lb n="20124"/>hands and in their hair. </p>
                    <lb n="20125"/><p>  Aubrey and Stephen had a common milkman and often they 
                        <lb n="20126"/>drove out in the milkcar to <place><location><geo>53.250224 -6.179926</geo></location><placeName>Carrickmines</placeName></place> where the cows were 
                        <lb n="20127"/>at grass. While the men were milking the boys would take turns 
                        <lb n="20128"/>in riding the tractable mare round the field. But when autumn 
                        <lb n="20129"/>came the cows were driven home from the grass: and the first 
                        <lb n="20130"/>sight of the filthy cowyard at <place><location><geo>53.300791 -6.177067</geo></location><placeName>Stradbrook</placeName></place> with its foul green 
                        <lb n="20131"/>puddles and clots of liquid dung and steaming brantroughs 
                        <lb n="20132"/>sickened Stephen's heart. The cattle which had seemed so beau- 
                        <lb n="20133"/>tiful in the country on sunny days revolted him and he could 
                        <lb n="20134"/>not even look at the milk they yielded. </p>
                    <lb n="20135"/><p>  The coming of September did not trouble him this year for 
                        <lb n="20136"/>he knew he was not to be sent back to <place><location><geo>53.310770 -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>. The practice 
                        <lb n="20137"/>in the park came to an end when Mike Flynn went into hospi- 
                        <lb n="20138"/>tal. Aubrey was at school and had only an hour or two free in 
                        <lb n="20139"/>the evening. The gang fell asunder and there were no more 
                        <lb n="20140"/>nightly forays or battles on the rocks. Stephen sometimes went 
                        <lb n="20141"/>round with the car which delivered the evening milk: and these 
                        <lb n="20142"/>chilly drives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard 
                        <lb n="20143"/>and he felt no repugnance at seeing the cowhairs and hayseeds 
                        <lb n="20144"/>on the milkman's coat. Whenever the car drew up before a 
                        <lb n="20145"/>house he waited to catch a glimpse of a well scrubbed kitchen 
                        <lb n="20146"/>or of a softly lighted hall and to see how the servant would 
                        <lb n="20147"/>hold the jug and how she would close the door. He thought it 
                        <lb n="20148"/>should be a pleasant life enough, driving along the roads every 
                        <lb n="20149"/>evening to deliver milk, if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of 
                        <lb n="20150"/>gingernuts in his pocket to eat from. But the same foreknowl- 
                        <lb n="20151"/>edge which had sickened his heart and made his limbs sag 
                        <lb n="20152"/>suddenly as he raced round the park, the same intuition which 
                        <lb n="20153"/>had made him glance with mistrust at his trainer's flabby 
                        <lb n="20154"/>stubblecovered face as it bent heavily over his long stained 
                        <lb n="20155"/>fingers, dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he 
                        <lb n="20156"/>understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the 
                        <lb n="20157"/>reason why he himself had not been sent back to <place><location><geo>53.310770 -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>. 
                        <lb n="20158"/>For some time he had felt the slight changes in his house; and 
                        <lb n="20159"/>these changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so 
                        <lb n="20160"/>many slight shocks to his boyish conception of the world. The 
                        <lb n="20161"/>ambition which he felt astir at times in the darkness of his soul 
                        <lb n="20162"/>sought no outlet. A dusk like that of the outer world obscured 
                        <lb n="20163"/>his mind as he heard the mare's hoofs clattering along the 
                        <lb n="20164"/>tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and 
                        <lb n="20165"/>rattling behind him. </p>
                    <lb n="20166"/><p>  He returned to Mercedes and, as he brooded upon her im- 
                        <lb n="20167"/>age, a strange unrest crept into his blood. Sometimes a fever 
                        <lb n="20168"/>gathered within him and led him to rove alone in the evening 
                        <lb n="20169"/>along the quiet avenues. The peace of the gardens and the 
                        <lb n="20170"/>kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence into his 
                        <lb n="20171"/>restless heart. The noise of children at play annoyed him and 
                        <lb n="20172"/>their silly voices made him feel, even more keenly than he had 
                        <lb n="20173"/>felt at <place><location><geo>53.310770 -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>, that he was different from others. He did 
                        <lb n="20174"/>not want to play. He wanted to meet in the real world the 
                        <lb n="20175"/>unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld. He 
                        <lb n="20176"/>did not know where to seek it or how: but a premonition which 
                        <lb n="20177"/>led him on told him that this image would, without any overt 
                        <lb n="20178"/>act of his, encounter him. They would meet quietly as if they 
                        <lb n="20179"/>had known each other and had made their tryst, perhaps at one 
                        <lb n="20180"/>of the gates or in some more secret place. They would be alone, 
                        <lb n="20181"/>surrounded by darkness and silence: and in that moment of 
                        <lb n="20182"/>supreme tenderness he would be transfigured. He would fade 
                        <lb n="20183"/>into something impalpable under her eyes and then, in a mo- 
                        <lb n="20184"/>ment, he would be transfigured. Weakness and timidity and 
                        <lb n="20185"/>inexperience would fall from him in that magic moment. </p>

                        <lb n="20188"/>mantle it. The furniture had been hustled out through the front 
                        <lb n="20189"/>garden which was strewn with wisps of straw and rope ends 
                        <lb n="20190"/>and into the huge vans at the gate. When all had been safely 
                        <lb n="20191"/>stowed the vans had set off noisily down the avenue: and from

                        <lb n="20196"/>lus rested the poker against the bars of the grate to attract the 
                        <lb n="20197"/>flame. Uncle Charles dozed in a corner of the half furnished 
                        <lb n="20198"/>uncarpeted room and near him the family portraits leaned 
                        <lb n="20199"/>against the wall. The lamp on the table shed a weak light over 
                        <lb n="20200"/>the boarded floor, muddied by the feet of the vanmen. Stephen 
                        <lb n="20201"/>sat on a footstool beside his father listening to a long and 
                        <lb n="20202"/>incoherent monologue. He understood little or nothing of it at 
                        <lb n="20203"/>first but he became slowly aware that his father had enemies 
                        <lb n="20204"/>and that some fight was going to take place. He felt, too, that 
                        <lb n="20205"/>he was being enlisted for the fight, that some duty was being 
                        <lb n="20206"/>laid upon his shoulders. The sudden flight from the comfort 
                        <lb n="20207"/>and revery of <place><location><geo>53.300907 -6.177049</geo></location><placeName>Blackrock</placeName></place>, the passage through the gloomy foggy 
                        <lb n="20208"/>city, the thought of the bare cheerless house in which they were 
                        <lb n="20209"/>now to live made his heart heavy: and again an intuition or 
                        <lb n="20210"/>foreknowledge of the future came to him. He understood also 
                        <lb n="20211"/>why the servants had often whispered together in the hall and 
                        <lb n="20212"/>why his father had often stood on the hearthrug, with his back 
                        <lb n="20213"/>to the fire, talking loudly to uncle Charles who urged him to sit 
                        <lb n="20214"/>down and eat his dinner. 
                        <lb n="20215"/><said who="Simon Dedalus">―There's a crack of the whip left in me yet, Stephen, old chap, 
                            <lb n="20216"/>said Mr Dedalus, poking at the dull fire with fierce energy. 
                            <lb n="20217"/>We're not dead yet, sonny. No, by the Lord Jesus (God forgive 
                            <lb n="20218"/>me) nor half dead. </said> </p>

                        <lb n="20220"/>had grown so witless that he could no longer be sent out on 
                        <lb n="20221"/>errands and the disorder in settling in the new house left Ste- 
                        <lb n="20222"/>phen freer than he had been in <place><location><geo>53.300907 -6.177049</geo></location><placeName>Blackrock</placeName></place>. In the beginning he 
                        <lb n="20223"/>contented himself with circling timidly round the neighbouring 
                        <lb n="20224"/>square or, at most, going half way down one of the side streets: 
                        <lb n="20225"/>but when he had made a skeleton map of the city in his mind he 
                        <lb n="20226"/>followed boldly one of its central lines until he reached the 
                        <lb n="20227"/>customhouse. He passed unchallenged among the docks and 
                        <lb n="20228"/>along the quays wondering at the multitude of corks that lay 
                        <lb n="20229"/>bobbing on the surface of the water in a thick yellow scum, at 
                        <lb n="20230"/>the crowds of quay porters and the rumbling carts and the 
                        <lb n="20231"/>illdressed bearded policeman. The vastness and strangeness of 
                        <lb n="20232"/>the life suggested to him by the bales of merchandise stacked 
                        <lb n="20233"/>along the walls or swung aloft out of the holds of steamers 
                        <lb n="20234"/>wakened again in him the unrest which had sent him wan- 
                        <lb n="20235"/>dering in the evening from garden to garden in search of 
                        <lb n="20236"/>Mercedes. And amid this new bustling life he might have 
                        <lb n="20237"/>fancied himself in another <place><location><geo>43.295207 5.364077</geo></location><placeName>Marseilles</placeName></place> but that he missed the 
                        <lb n="20238"/>bright sky and the sunwarmed trellisses of the wineshops. A 
                        <lb n="20239"/>vague dissatisfaction grew up within him as he looked on the 
                        <lb n="20240"/>quays and on the river and on the lowering skies and yet he 
                        <lb n="20241"/>continued to wander up and down day after day as if he really 
                        <lb n="20242"/>sought someone that eluded him. </p>
                    <lb n="20243"/><p>  He went once or twice with his mother to visit their rela- 
                        <lb n="20244"/>tives: and, though they passed a jovial array of shops lit up and 
                        <lb n="20245"/>adorned for Christmas, his mood of embittered silence did not 
                        <lb n="20246"/>leave him. The causes of his embitterment were many, remote 
                        <lb n="20247"/>and near. He was angry with himself for being young and the 
                        <lb n="20248"/>prey of restless foolish impulses, angry also with the change of 
                        <lb n="20249"/>fortune which was reshaping the world about him into a vision 
                        <lb n="20250"/>of squalor and insincerity. Yet his anger lent nothing to the 
                        <lb n="20251"/>vision. He chronicled with patience what he saw, detaching 
                        <lb n="20252"/>himself from it and tasting its mortifying flavour in secret. </p>
                    <lb n="20253"/><p>  He was sitting on the backless chair in his aunt's kitchen. A 
                        <lb n="20254"/>lamp with a reflector hung on the japanned wall of the fire- 
                        <lb n="20255"/>place and by its light his aunt was reading the evening paper 
                        <lb n="20256"/>that lay on her knees. She looked a long time at a smiling 
                        <lb n="20257"/>picture that was set in it and said musingly: </p>
                    <lb n="20258"/><said who="his aunt">―The beautiful Mabel Hunter! </said>
                    <lb n="20259"/><p>  A ringletted girl stood on tiptoe to peer at the picture and 
                        <lb n="20260"/>said softly: 
                        <lb n="20261"/><said who="ringletted girl">―What is she in, mud?  </said>
                        <lb n="20262"/><said who="ringletted girl's mother">―In the pantomime, love. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20263"/><p>  The child leaned her ringletted head against her mother's 
                        <lb n="20264"/>sleeve, gazing on the picture and murmured, as if fascinated: 
                        <lb n="20265"/><said who="ringletted girl">―The beautiful Mabel Hunter! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20266"/><p>  As if fascinated, her eyes rested long upon those demurely 
                        <lb n="20267"/>taunting eyes and she murmured again devotedly: 
                        <lb n="20268"/><said who="ringletted girl">―Isn't she an exquisite creature? </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20269"/><p>  And the boy who came in from the street, stamping crook- 
                        <lb n="20270"/>edly under his stone of coal, heard her words. He dropped his 
                        <lb n="20271"/>load promptly on the floor and hurried to her side to see. But 
                        <lb n="20272"/>she did not raise her easeful head to let him see. He mauled the 
                        <lb n="20273"/>edges of the paper with his reddened and blackened hands, 
                        <lb n="20274"/>shouldering her aside and complaining that he could not see. </p>
                    <lb n="20275"/><p>  He was sitting in the narrow breakfast room high up in the 
                        <lb n="20276"/>old darkwindowed house. The firelight flickered on the wall 
                        <lb n="20277"/>and beyond the window a spectral dusk was gathering upon the 
                        <lb n="20278"/>river. Before the fire an old woman was busy making tea and, 
                        <lb n="20279"/>as she bustled at her task, she told in a low voice of what the 
                        <lb n="20280"/>priest and the doctor had said. She told too of certain changes 
                        <lb n="20281"/>that she had seen in her of late and of her odd ways and 
                        <lb n="20282"/>sayings. He sat listening to the words and following the ways 
                        <lb n="20283"/>of adventure that lay open in the coals, arches and vaults and 
                        <lb n="20284"/>winding galleries and jagged caverns. </p>
                    <lb n="20285"/><p>  Suddenly he became aware of something in the doorway. A 
                        <lb n="20286"/>skull appeared suspended in the gloom of the doorway. A 
                        <lb n="20287"/>feeble creature like a monkey was there, drawn thither by the 
                        <lb n="20288"/>sound of voices at the fire. A whining voice came from the 
                        <lb n="20289"/>door, asking: 
                        <lb n="20290"/><said who="Ellen">―Is that Josephine? </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20291"/><p>  The old bustling woman answered cheerily from the fire- 
                        <lb n="20292"/>place: 
                        <lb n="20293"/><said who="old woman">―No, Ellen. It's Stephen.  </said>
                        <lb n="20294"/><said who="Ellen">―O .... O, good evening, Stephen. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20295"/><p>  He answered the greeting and saw a silly smile break out 
                        <lb n="20296"/>over the face in the doorway. 
                        <lb n="20297"/><said who="old woman">―Do you want anything, Ellen? asked the old woman at the 
                            <lb n="20298"/>fire.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="20299"/><p>  But she did not answer the question and said: 
                        <lb n="20300"/><said who="Ellen">―I thought it was Josephine. I thought you were Josephine, 
                            <lb n="20301"/>Stephen.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="20302"/><p>  And, repeating this several times, she fell to laughing feebly. </p>
                    <lb n="20303"/><p>  He was sitting in the midst of a children's party at <place><location><geo>53.324608 
                                    -6.281580</geo></location><placeName>Harold's
                                <lb n="20304"/>Cross</placeName></place>. His silent watchful manner had grown upon him and he 
                        <lb n="20305"/>took little part in the games. The children, wearing the spoils of 
                        <lb n="20306"/>their crackers, danced and romped noisily and, though he tried 
                        <lb n="20307"/>to share their merriment, he felt himself a gloomy figure amid 
                        <lb n="20308"/>the gay cocked hats and sunbonnets. </p>
                    <lb n="20309"/><p>  But when he had sung his song and withdrawn into a snug 
                        <lb n="20310"/>corner of the room he began to taste the joy of his loneliness. 
                        <lb n="20311"/>The mirth, which in the beginning of the evening had seemed 
                        <lb n="20312"/>to him false and trivial, was like a soothing air to him, passing 
                        <lb n="20313"/>gaily by his senses, hiding from other eyes the feverish agitation 
                        <lb n="20314"/>of his blood while through the circling of the dancers and amid 
                        <lb n="20315"/>the music and laughter her glances travelled to his corner, 
                        <lb n="20316"/>flattering, taunting, searching, exciting his heart. </p>
                    <lb n="20317"/><p>  In the hall the children who had stayed latest were putting 
                        <lb n="20318"/>on their things: the party was over. She had thrown a shawl 
                        <lb n="20319"/>about her and, as they went together towards the tram, sprays 
                        <lb n="20320"/>of her fresh warm breath flew gaily above her cowled head and 
                        <lb n="20321"/>her shoes tapped blithely on the glassy road. </p>
                    <lb n="20322"/><p>  It was the last tram. The lank brown horses knew it and 
                        <lb n="20323"/>shook their bells to the clear night in admonition. The conductor 
                        <lb n="20324"/>tor talked with the driver, both nodding often in the green light 
                        <lb n="20325"/>of the lamp. On the empty seats of the tram were scattered a 
                        <lb n="20326"/>few coloured tickets. No sound of footsteps came up or down 
                        <lb n="20327"/>the road. No sound broke the peace of the night save when the 
                        <lb n="20328"/>lank brown horses rubbed their noses together and shook their 
                        <lb n="20329"/>bells. </p>
                    <lb n="20330"/><p>  They seemed to listen, he on the upper step and she on the 
                        <lb n="20331"/>lower. She came up to his step many times and went down to 
                        <lb n="20332"/>hers again between their phrases and once or twice stood close 
                        <lb n="20333"/>beside him for some moments on the upper step, forgetting to 
                        <lb n="20334"/>go down, and then went down. His heart danced upon her 
                        <lb n="20335"/>movements like a cork upon a tide. He heard what her eyes 
                        <lb n="20336"/>said to him from beneath their cowl and knew that in some dim 
                        <lb n="20337"/>past, whether in life or in revery, he had heard their tale before. 
                        <lb n="20338"/>He saw her urge her vanities, her fine dress and sash and long 
                        <lb n="20339"/>black stockings, and knew that he had yielded to them a thou- 
                        <lb n="20340"/>sand times. Yet a voice within him spoke above the noise of his 
                        <lb n="20341"/>dancing heart, asking him would he take her gift to which he 
                        <lb n="20342"/>had only to stretch out his hand. And he remembered the day 
                        <lb n="20343"/>when he and Eileen had stood looking into the hotel grounds, 
                        <lb n="20344"/>watching the waiters running up a trail of bunting on the 
                        <lb n="20345"/>flagstaff and the foxterrier scampering to and fro on the sunny 
                        <lb n="20346"/>lawn, and how, all of a sudden, she had broken out into a peal 
                        <lb n="20347"/>of laughter and had run down the sloping curve of the path. 
                        <lb n="20348"/>Now, as then, he stood listlessly in his place, seemingly a 
                        <lb n="20349"/>tranquil watcher of the scene before him. </p>
                    <lb n="20350"/><p> ―She too wants me to catch hold of her, he thought. That's 
                        <lb n="20351"/>why she came with me to the tram. I could easily catch hold of 
                        <lb n="20352"/>her when she comes up to my step: nobody is looking. I could 
                        <lb n="20353"/>hold her and kiss her. </p>
                    <lb n="20354"/><p>  But he did neither: and, when he was sitting alone in the 
                        <lb n="20355"/>deserted tram, he tore his ticket into shreds and stared gloomily 
                        <lb n="20356"/>at the corrugated footboard. </p>
                    <lb n="20357"/><p>  The next day he sat at his table in the bare upper room for 
                        <lb n="20358"/>many hours. Before him lay a new pen, a new bottle of ink and 
                        <lb n="20359"/>a new emerald exercise. From force of habit he had written at 
                        <lb n="20360"/>the top of the first page the initial letters of the jesuit motto: 
                        <lb n="20361"/>A. M. D. G. On the first line of the page appeared the title of 
                        <lb n="20362"/>the verses he was trying to write: To E-- C--. He knew it was 
                        <lb n="20363"/>right to begin so for he had seen similar titles in the collected 
                        <lb n="20364"/>poems of Lord Byron. When he had written this title and 
                        <lb n="20365"/>drawn an ornamental line underneath he fell into a daydream 
                        <lb n="20366"/>and began to draw diagrams on the cover of the book. He saw 
                        <lb n="20367"/>himself sitting at his table in Bray the morning after the dis- 
                        <lb n="20368"/>cussion at the Christmas dinnertable, trying to write a poem 
                        <lb n="20369"/>about Parnell on the back of one of his father's second moiety 
                        <lb n="20370"/>notices. But his brain had then refused to grapple with the 
                        <lb n="20371"/>theme and, desisting, he had covered the page with the names 
                        <lb n="20372"/>and addresses of certain of his classmates: 
                        <lb n="20373"/>Roderick Kickham 
                        <lb n="20374"/>John Lawton 
                        <lb n="20375"/>Anthony MacSwiney

                    <lb n="20377"/><p>  Now it seemed as if he would fail again but, by dint of 
                        <lb n="20378"/>brooding on the incident, he thought himself into confidence. 
                        <lb n="20379"/>During this process all those elements which he deemed com- 
                        <lb n="20380"/>mon and insignificant fell out of the scene. There remained no 
                        <lb n="20381"/>trace of the tram itself nor of the trammen nor of the horses: 
                        <lb n="20382"/>nor did he and she appear vividly. The verses told only of the 
                        <lb n="20383"/>night and the balmy breeze and the maiden lustre of the moon. 
                        <lb n="20384"/>Some undefined sorrow was hidden in the hearts of the protag- 
                        <lb n="20385"/>onists as they stood in silence beneath the leafless trees and 
                        <lb n="20386"/>when the moment of farewell had come the kiss, which had 
                        <lb n="20387"/>been withheld by one, was given by both. After this the letters 
                        <lb n="20388"/>L. D. S. were written at the foot of the page and, having hidden 
                        <lb n="20389"/>the book, he went into his mother's bedroom and gazed at his 
                        <lb n="20390"/>face for a long time in the mirror of her dressingtable. </p>

                        <lb n="20392"/>end. One evening his father came home full of news which kept 
                        <lb n="20393"/>his tongue busy all through dinner. Stephen had been awaiting

                        <lb n="20457"/>from the window of the dressingroom looked out on  the small 
                        <lb n="20458"/>grassplot across which lines of Chinese lanterns were stretched. 
                        <lb n="20459"/>He watched the visitors come down the steps from the house 
                        <lb n="20460"/>and pass into the theatre. Stewards in evening dress, old Belve- 
                        <lb n="20461"/>dereans, loitered in groups about the entrance to the theatre 
                        <lb n="20462"/>and ushered in the visitors with ceremony. Under the sudden 
                        <lb n="20463"/>glow of a lantern he could recognise the smiling face of a priest. </p>
                    <lb n="20464"/><p>  The Blessed Sacrament had been removed from the taber- 
                        <lb n="20465"/>nacle and the first benches had been driven back so as to leave 
                        <lb n="20466"/>the dais of the altar and the space before it free. Against the 
                        <lb n="20467"/>walls stood companies of barbells and Indian clubs; the dumb- 
                        <lb n="20468"/>bells were piled in one corner: and in the midst of countless 
                        <lb n="20469"/>hillocks of gymnasium shoes and sweaters and singlets in 
                        <lb n="20470"/>untidy brown parcels there stood the stout leatherjacketed 
                        <lb n="20471"/>vaulting horse waiting its turn to be carried up on to the stage. 
                        <lb n="20472"/>A large bronze shield, tipped with silver, leaned against the

                        <lb n="20478"/>part in the first section of the programme: but in the play 
                        <lb n="20479"/>which formed the second section he had the chief part, that of a 
                        <lb n="20480"/>farcical pedagogue. He had been cast for it on account of his 
                        <lb n="20481"/>stature and grave manners for he was now at the end of his 
                        <lb n="20482"/>second year at Belvedere and in number two. </p>
                    <lb n="20483"/><p>  A score of the younger boys in white knickers and singlets 
                        <lb n="20484"/>came pattering down from the stage, through the vestry and 
                        <lb n="20485"/>into the chapel. The vestry and chapel were peopled with eager 
                        <lb n="20486"/>masters and boys. The plump bald sergeantmajor was testing 
                        <lb n="20487"/>with his foot the springboard of the vaulting horse. The lean 
                        <lb n="20488"/>young man in a long overcoat, who was to give a special 
                        <lb n="20489"/>display of intricate club swinging, stood near watching with 
                        <lb n="20490"/>interest, his silvercoated clubs peeping out of his deep side- 
                        <lb n="20491"/>pockets. The hollow rattle of the wooden dumbbells was heard 
                        <lb n="20492"/>as another team made ready to go up on the stage: and in 
                        <lb n="20493"/>another moment the excited prefect was hustling the boys 
                        <lb n="20494"/>through the vestry like a flock of geese, flapping the wings of 
                        <lb n="20495"/>his soutane nervously and crying to the laggards to make haste. 
                        <lb n="20496"/>A little troop  of Neapolitan peasants were practising their steps 
                        <lb n="20497"/>at the end of the chapel, some arching their arms above their 
                        <lb n="20498"/>heads, some swaying their baskets of paper violets and curtsey- 
                        <lb n="20499"/>ing. In a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel side of the altar 
                        <lb n="20500"/>a stout old lady knelt amid her copious black skirts. When she 
                        <lb n="20501"/>stood up a pinkdressed figure, wearing a curly golden wig and 
                        <lb n="20502"/>an oldfashioned straw sunbonnet, with black pencilled eye- 
                        <lb n="20503"/>brows and cheeks delicately rouged and powdered, was dis- 
                        <lb n="20504"/>covered. A low murmur of curiosity ran round the chapel at the 
                        <lb n="20505"/>discovery of this girlish figure. One of the prefects, smiling and 
                        <lb n="20506"/>nodding his head, approached the dark corner and, having 
                        <lb n="20507"/>bowed to the stout old lady, said pleasantly: 
                        <lb n="20508"/><said who="a prefect">―Is this a beautiful young lady or a doll that you have here, 
                            <lb n="20509"/>Mrs Tallon?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="20510"/><p>  Then, bending down to peer at the smiling painted face un- 
                        <lb n="20511"/>der the leaf of the bonnet, he exclaimed: 
                        <lb n="20512"/><said who="a prefect">―No! Upon my word I believe it's little Bertie Tallon after all! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20513"/><p>  Stephen at his post by the window heard the old lady and 
                        <lb n="20514"/>the priest laugh together and heard the boys' murmur of ad- 
                        <lb n="20515"/>miration behind him as they pressed forward to see the little 
                        <lb n="20516"/>boy who had to dance the sunbonnet dance by himself. A 
                        <lb n="20517"/>movement of impatience escaped him. He let the edge of the 
                        <lb n="20518"/>blind fall and, stepping down from the bench on which he had 
                        <lb n="20519"/>been standing, walked out of the chapel. </p>
                    <lb n="20520"/><p>  He passed out of the schoolhouse and halted under the shed 
                        <lb n="20521"/>that flanked the garden. From the theatre opposite came the 
                        <lb n="20522"/>muffled noise of the audience and sudden brazen clashes of the 
                        <lb n="20523"/>soldiers' band. The light spread upwards from the glass roof 
                        <lb n="20524"/>making the theatre seem a festive ark, anchored amid the hulks 
                        <lb n="20525"/>of houses, her frail cables of lanterns looping her to her moor- 
                        <lb n="20526"/>ings. A sidedoor of the theatre opened suddenly and a shaft of 
                        <lb n="20527"/>light flew across the grassplots. A sudden burst of music issued 
                        <lb n="20528"/>from the ark, the prelude of a waltz: and when the sidedoor 
                        <lb n="20529"/>closed again the listener could hear the faint rhythm of the 
                        <lb n="20530"/>music. The sentiment of the opening bars, their languor and 
                        <lb n="20531"/>supple movement, evoked the incommunicable emotion which 
                        <lb n="20532"/>had been the cause of all his day's unrest and of his impatient 
                        <lb n="20533"/>movement of a moment before. His unrest issued from him like 
                        <lb n="20534"/>a wave of sound: and on the tide of flowing music the ark was 
                        <lb n="20535"/>journeying, trailing her cables of lanterns in her wake. Then a 
                        <lb n="20536"/>noise like dwarf artillery broke the movement. It was the 
                        <lb n="20537"/>clapping that greeted the entry of the dumbbell team on the 
                        <lb n="20538"/>stage. </p>
                    <lb n="20539"/><p>  At the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink 
                        <lb n="20540"/>light showed in the darkness and as he walked towards it he 
                        <lb n="20541"/>became aware of a faint aromatic odour. Two boys were 
                        <lb n="20542"/>standing in the shelter of the doorway, smoking, and before he 
                        <lb n="20543"/>reached them he had recognised Heron by his voice. 
                        <lb n="20544"/><said who="Heron">―Here comes the noble Dedalus!</said> cried a high throaty voice. 
                        <lb n="20545"/><said who="heron">Welcome to our trusty friend! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20546"/><p>  This welcome ended in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as 
                        <lb n="20547"/>Heron salaamed and then began to poke the ground with his 
                        <lb n="20548"/>cane. 
                        <lb n="20549"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Here I am</said>, said Stephen, halting and glancing from Heron to 
                        <lb n="20550"/>his friend.  </p>
                    <lb n="20551"/><p>  The latter was a stranger to him but in the darkness, by the 
                        <lb n="20552"/>aid of the glowing cigarette tips, he could make out a pale 
                        <lb n="20553"/>dandyish face, over which a smile was travelling slowly, a tall 
                        <lb n="20554"/>overcoated figure and a hard hat. Heron did not trouble him- 
                        <lb n="20555"/>self about an introduction but said instead: 
                        <lb n="20556"/><said who="Heron">―I was just telling my friend Wallis what a lark it would be 
                            <lb n="20557"/>tonight if you took off the rector in the part of the school- 
                            <lb n="20558"/>master. It would be a ripping good joke. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20559"/><p>  Heron made a poor attempt to imitate for his friend Wallis 
                        <lb n="20560"/>the rector's pedantic bass and then, laughing at his failure, 
                        <lb n="20561"/>asked Stephen to do it. 
                        <lb n="20562"/><said who="Heron">―Go on, Dedalus</said>, he urged. <said who="Heron">You can take him off rippingly.</said>
                        <lg>
                            <lb n="20563"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus"><l>He that will not hear the churcha let him be to theea as</l> <l>the 
                                    <lb n="20564"/>heathena and the publicana.</l></said>
                    </lg></p>
                    <lb n="20565"/><p>  The imitation was prevented by a mild expression of anger 
                        <lb n="20566"/>from Wallis in whose mouthpiece the cigarette had become too 
                        <lb n="20567"/>tightly wedged. 
                        <lb n="20568"/><said who="Wallis">―Damn this blankety blank holder</said>, he said, taking it from his 
                        <lb n="20569"/>mouth and smiling and frowning upon it tolerantly. <said who="Wallis">It's always 
                            <lb n="20570"/>getting stuck like that. Do you use a holder?  </said>
                        <lb n="20571"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I don't smoke, answered Stephen.  </said>
                        <lb n="20572"/><said who="Heron">―No,</said> said Heron, <said who="Heron">Dedalus is a model youth. He doesn't 
                            <lb n="20573"/>smoke and he doesn't go to bazaars and he doesn't flirt and he 
                            <lb n="20574"/>doesn't damn anything or damn all. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20575"/><p>  Stephen shook his head and smiled in his rival's flushed and 
                        <lb n="20576"/>mobile face, beaked like a bird's. He had often thought it 
                        <lb n="20577"/>strange that Vincent Heron had a bird's face as well as a bird's 
                        <lb n="20578"/>name. A shock of pale hair lay on the forehead like a ruffled 
                        <lb n="20579"/>crest: the forehead was narrow and bony and a thin hooked 
                        <lb n="20580"/>nose stood out between the closeset prominent eyes which were 
                        <lb n="20581"/>light and inexpressive. The rivals were school friends. They sat 
                        <lb n="20582"/>together in class, knelt together in the chapel, talked together 
                        <lb n="20583"/>after beads over their lunches. As the fellows in number one 
                        <lb n="20584"/>were undistinguished dullards Stephen and Heron had been 
                        <lb n="20585"/>during the year the virtual heads of the school. It was they who 
                        <lb n="20586"/>went up to the rector together to ask for a free day or to get a 
                        <lb n="20587"/>fellow off. 
                        <lb n="20588"/><said who="Heron">―O by the way</said>, said Heron suddenly, <said who="Heron">I saw your governor 
                            <lb n="20589"/>going in. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20590"/><p>  The smile waned on Stephen's face. Any allusion made to his 
                        <lb n="20591"/>father by a fellow or by a master put his calm to rout in a 
                        <lb n="20592"/>moment. He waited in timorous silence to hear what Heron 
                        <lb n="20593"/>might say next. Heron, however, nudged him expressively with 
                        <lb n="20594"/>his elbow and said: 
                        <lb n="20595"/><said who="Heron">―You're a sly dog, Dedalus!  </said>
                        <lb n="20596"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Why so?</said> said Stephen. 
                        <lb n="20597"/><said who="Heron">―You'd think butter wouldn't melt in your mouth</said>, said 
                        <lb n="20598"/>Heron. <said who="Heron">But I'm afraid you're a sly dog.  </said>
                        <lb n="20599"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Might I ask you what you are talking about?</said> said Stephen 
                        <lb n="20600"/>urbanely.
                        <lb n="20601"/><said who="Heron">―Indeed  you might</said>, answered Heron. <said who="Heron">>We saw her, Wallis, 
                            <lb n="20602"/>didn't we? And deucedly pretty she is too. And so inquisitive! 
                            <lb n="20603"/><emph>And what part does Stephen take, Mr Dedalus? And will 
                                <lb n="20604"/>Stephen not sing, Mr Dedalus?</emph> Your governor was staring at 
                            <lb n="20605"/>her through that eyeglass of his for all he was worth so that I 
                            <lb n="20606"/>think the old man has found you out too. I wouldn't care a bit, 
                            <lb n="20607"/>by Jove. She's  ripping, isn't she, Wallis?  </said>
                        <lb n="20608"/><said who="Wallis">―Not half bad</said>, answered Wallis quietly as he placed his 
                        <lb n="20609"/>holder once more in a corner of his mouth.  </p>
                    <lb n="20610"/><p>  A shaft of momentary anger flew through Stephen's mind at 
                        <lb n="20611"/>these indelicate allusions in the hearing of a stranger. For him 
                        <lb n="20612"/>there was nothing amusing in a girl's interest and regard. All 
                        <lb n="20613"/>day he had thought of nothing but their leavetaking on the 
                        <lb n="20614"/>steps of the tram at <place><location><geo>53.324608 -6.281580</geo></location><placeName>Harold's Cross</placeName></place>, the stream of moody 
                        <lb n="20615"/>emotions it had made to course through him and the poem he 
                        <lb n="20616"/>had written about it. All day he had imagined a new meeting 
                        <lb n="20617"/>with her for he knew that she was to come to the play. The old 
                        <lb n="20618"/>restless moodiness had again filled his heart as it had done on 
                        <lb n="20619"/>the night of the party but had not found  an outlet in verse. The 
                        <lb n="20620"/>growth and knowledge of two years of boyhood stood between 
                        <lb n="20621"/>then and now, forbidding such an outlet: and all day the stream 
                        <lb n="20622"/>of gloomy tenderness within him had started forth and re- 
                        <lb n="20623"/>turned upon itself in dark courses and eddies, wearying him in 
                        <lb n="20624"/>the end until the pleasantry of the prefect and the painted little 
                        <lb n="20625"/>boy had drawn from him a movement of impatience. 
                        <lb n="20626"/><said who="Heron">―So you may as well admit</said>, Heron went on, <said who="Heron">that we've fairly 
                            <lb n="20627"/>found you out this time. You can't play the saint on me any 
                            <lb n="20628"/>more, that's one sure five. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20629"/><p>  A soft peal of mirthless laughter escaped from his lips and, 
                        <lb n="20630"/>bending down as before, he struck Stephen lightly across the 
                        <lb n="20631"/>calf of the leg with his cane, as if in jesting reproof. </p>
                    <lb n="20632"/><p>  Stephen's moment of anger had already passed. He was nei- 
                        <lb n="20633"/>ther flattered nor confused but simply wished the banter to 
                        <lb n="20634"/>end. He scarcely resented what had seemed to him at first a 
                        <lb n="20635"/>silly indelicateness for he knew that the adventure in his mind 
                        <lb n="20636"/>stood in no danger from their words: and his face mirrored his 
                        <lb n="20637"/>rival's false smile. 
                        <lb n="20638"/><said who="Heron">―Admit!</said> repeated Heron, striking him again with his cane 
                        <lb n="20639"/>across the calf of the leg. </p>
                    <lb n="20640"/><p>  The stroke was playful but not so lightly given as the first 
                        <lb n="20641"/>one had been. Stephen felt the skin tingle and glow slightly and 
                        <lb n="20642"/>almost painlessly; and bowing submissively, as if to meet his 
                        <lb n="20643"/>companion's jesting mood, began to recite the <seg xml:lang="la">Confiteor</seg>. The 
                        <lb n="20644"/>episode ended well for both Heron and Wallis laughed indul- 
                        <lb n="20645"/>gently at the irreverence. </p>
                    <lb n="20646"/><p>  The confession came only from Stephen's lips and, while 
                        <lb n="20647"/>they spoke the words, a sudden memory had carried him to 
                        <lb n="20648"/>another scene called up, as if by magic, at the moment when he 
                        <lb n="20649"/>had noted the faint cruel dimples at the corners of Heron's 
                        <lb n="20650"/>smiling lips and had felt the familiar stroke of the cane against 
                        <lb n="20651"/>his calf and had heard the familiar word of admonition: 
                        <lb n="20652"/><said who="Heron">―Admit!</said> </p>
                    <lb n="20653"/><p>  It was towards the close of his first term in the college when 
                        <lb n="20654"/>he was in number six. His sensitive nature was still smarting 
                        <lb n="20655"/>under the lashes of an undivined and squalid way of life. His 
                        <lb n="20656"/>soul was still disquieted and cast down by the dull phenom- 
                        <lb n="20657"/>enon of <place><location><geo>53.349307 -6.263654</geo></location><placeName>Dublin</placeName></place>. He had emerged from a two years' spell of 
                        <lb n="20658"/>revery to find himself in the midst of a new scene, every event 
                        <lb n="20659"/>and figure of which affected him intimately, disheartened him 
                        <lb n="20660"/>or allured him and, whether alluring or disheartening, filled 
                        <lb n="20661"/>him always with unrest and bitter thoughts. All the leisure that 
                        <lb n="20662"/>his school life left him was passed in the company of subversive 
                        <lb n="20663"/>writers whose gibes and violence of speech set up a ferment in 
                        <lb n="20664"/>his brain before they passed out of it into his crude writings. </p>
                    <lb n="20665"/><p>  The essay was for him the chief labour of his week and every 
                        <lb n="20666"/>Tuesday, as he marched from home to the school, he read his 
                        <lb n="20667"/>fate in the incidents of the way, pitting himself against some 
                        <lb n="20668"/>figure ahead of him and quickening his pace to outstrip it be- 
                        <lb n="20669"/>fore a certain goal was reached or planting his steps scrupu- 
                        <lb n="20670"/>lously in the spaces of the patchwork of the footpath and 
                        <lb n="20671"/>telling himself that he would be first and not first in the weekly 
                        <lb n="20672"/>essay. </p>
                    <lb n="20673"/><p>  On a certain Tuesday the course of his triumphs was rudely 
                        <lb n="20674"/>broken. Mr Tate, the English master, pointed his finger at him 
                        <lb n="20675"/>and said bluntly: 
                        <lb n="20676"/><said who="Mr Tate">―This fellow has heresy in his essay. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20677"/><p>  A hush fell on the class. Mr Tate did not break it but dug 
                        <lb n="20678"/>with his hand between his crossed thighs while his heavily 
                        <lb n="20679"/>starched linen creaked about his neck and wrists. Stephen did 
                        <lb n="20680"/>not look up. It was a raw spring morning and his eyes were still 
                        <lb n="20681"/>smarting and weak. He was conscious of failure and of detec- 
                        <lb n="20682"/>tion, of the squalor of his own mind and home, and felt against 
                        <lb n="20683"/>his neck the raw edge of his turned and jagged collar. </p>
                    <lb n="20684"/><p>  A short loud laugh from Mr Tate set the class more at ease. 
                        <lb n="20685"/><said who="Mr Tate">―Perhaps you didn't know that</said>, he said. 
                        <lb n="20686"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Where?</said> asked Stephen.  </p>
                    <lb n="20687"/><p>  Mr Tate withdrew his delving hand and spread out the es- 
                        <lb n="20688"/>say. 
                        <lb n="20689"/><said who="Mr Tate">―Here. It's about the Creator and the soul. Rrm ... rrm ..... 
                            <lb n="20690"/>rrm ...  Ah! <emph>without a possibility of ever approaching nearer</emph>. 
                            <lb n="20691"/>That's heresy. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20692"/><p>  Stephen murmured: 
                        <lb n="20693"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I meant <emph>without a possibility of ever reaching</emph>. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20694"/><p>  It was a submission and Mr Tate, appeased, folded up the 
                        <lb n="20695"/>essay and passed it across to him, saying: 
                        <lb n="20696"/><said who="Mr Tate">―O ... Ah! <emph>ever reaching</emph>. That's another story. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20697"/><p>  But the class was not so soon appeased. Though nobody 
                        <lb n="20698"/>spoke to him of the affair after class he could feel about him a 
                        <lb n="20699"/>vague general malignant joy. </p>
                    <lb n="20700"/><p>  A few nights after this public chiding  he was walking with a 
                        <lb n="20701"/>letter along the <place><location><geo>53.36324 -6.25800</geo></location><placeName>Drumcondra Road</placeName></place> when he heard a voice cry: 
                        <lb n="20702"/><said who="Heron">―Halt! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20703"/><p>  He turned and saw three boys of his own class coming to- 
                        <lb n="20704"/>wards him in the dusk. It was Heron who had called out and, 
                        <lb n="20705"/>as he marched forward between his two attendants, he cleft the 
                        <lb n="20706"/>air before him with a thin cane, in time to their steps. Boland, 
                        <lb n="20707"/>his friend, marched beside him, a large grin on his face, while 
                        <lb n="20708"/>Nash came on a few steps behind, blowing from the pace and 
                        <lb n="20709"/>wagging his great red head. </p>
                    <lb n="20710"/><p>  As soon as the boys had turned into <place><location><geo>53.362304 -6.249867</geo></location><placeName>Clonliffe Road</placeName></place>together 
                        <lb n="20711"/>they began to speak about books and writers, saying what 
                        <lb n="20712"/>books they were reading and how many books there were in 
                        <lb n="20713"/>their fathers' bookcases at home. Stephen listened to them in 
                        <lb n="20714"/>some wonderment for Boland was the dunce and Nash the idler 
                        <lb n="20715"/>of the class. In fact after some talk about their favourite writers 
                        <lb n="20716"/>Nash declared for Captain Marryat who, he said, was the 
                        <lb n="20717"/>greatest writer. 
                        <lb n="20718"/><said who="Heron">―Fudge!</said> said Heron. <said who="Heron">Ask Dedalus. Who is the greatest writer, 
                            <lb n="20719"/>Dedalus?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="20720"/><p>  Stephen noted the mockery in the question and said: 
                        <lb n="20721"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Of prose, do you mean?  </said>
                        <lb n="20722"/><said who="Heron">―Yes. </said>
                        <lb n="20723"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Newman, I think.  </said>
                        <lb n="20724"/><said who="Boland">―Is it Cardinal Newman?</said> asked Boland. 
                        <lb n="20725"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Yes</said>, answered Stephen. </p>
                    <lb n="20726"/><p>  The grin broadened on Nash's freckled face as he turned to 
                        <lb n="20727"/>Stephen and said: 
                        <lb n="20728"/><said who="Nash">―And do you like Cardinal Newman, Dedalus?  </said>
                        <lb n="20729"/><said who="Heron">―O, many people say that Newman has the best prose style,</said> 
                        <lb n="20730"/>Heron said to the other two in explanation. <said who="Heron">Of course, he's not 
                            <lb n="20731"/>a poet.  </said>
                        <lb n="20732"/><said who="Boland">―And who is the best poet, Heron?</said> asked Boland. 
                        <lb n="20733"/><said who="Heron">―Lord Tennyson, of course</said>, answered Heron. 
                        <lb n="20734"/><said who="Nash">―O, yes, Lord Tennyson</said>, said Nash. <said who="Nash">We have all his poetry at 
                            <lb n="20735"/>home in a book. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20736"/><p>  At this Stephen forgot the silent vows he had been making 
                        <lb n="20737"/>and burst out: 
                        <lb n="20738"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Tennyson a poet! Why, he's only a rhymester!  </said>
                        <lb n="20739"/><said who="Heron">―O, get out!</said> said Heron. <said who="Heron">Everyone knows that Tennyson is 
                            <lb n="20740"/>the greatest poet.  </said>
                        <lb n="20741"/><said who="Boland">―And who do you think is the greatest poet?</said> asked Boland, 
                        <lb n="20742"/>nudging his neighbour. 
                        <lb n="20743"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Byron, of course</said>, answered Stephen.  </p>
                    <lb n="20744"/><p>  Heron gave the lead and all three joined in a scornful laugh. 
                        <lb n="20745"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―What are you laughing at?</said> asked Stephen. 
                        <lb n="20746"/><said who="Heron">―You</said>, said Heron. <said who="Heron">Byron the greatest poet! He's only a poet 
                            <lb n="20747"/>for uneducated people.  </said>
                        <lb n="20748"/><said who="Boland">―He must be a fine poet!</said> said Boland. 
                        <lb n="20749"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―You may keep your mouth shut, said Stephen, turning on 
                            <lb n="20750"/>him boldly. All you know about poetry is what you wrote up 
                            <lb n="20751"/>on the slates in the yard and were going to be sent to the loft 
                            <lb n="20752"/>for.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="20753"/><p>  Boland, in fact, was said to have written on the slates in the 
                        <lb n="20754"/>yard a couplet about a classmate of his who often rode home 
                        <lb n="20755"/>from the college on a pony: </p>
                    <lg>

                    </lg>
                    <lb n="20758"/><p>  This thrust put the two lieutenants to silence but Heron 
                        <lb n="20759"/>went on: 
                        <lb n="20760"/><said who="Heron">―In any case Byron was a heretic and immoral too.  </said>
                        <lb n="20761"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I don't care what he was, cried Stephen hotly.  </said>
                        <lb n="20762"/><said who="Nash">―You don't care whether he was a heretic or not? said Nash.  </said>
                        <lb n="20763"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―What do you know about it? shouted Stephen. You never 
                            <lb n="20764"/>read a line of anything in your life except a trans or Boland 
                            <lb n="20765"/>either. </said>

                    <lb n="20768"/><p>  In a moment Stephen was a prisoner. 
                        <lb n="20769"/><said who="Heron">―Tate made you buck up the other day, Heron went on, about

                        <lb n="20771"/><said who="Boland">―I'll tell him tomorrow, said Boland.  </said>
                        <lb n="20772"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Will you? said Stephen. You'd be afraid to open your lips.  </said>

                        <lb n="20774"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Ay. Afraid of your life.  </said>

                    <lb n="20777"/><p>  It was the signal for their  onset. Nash pinioned his arms 
                        <lb n="20778"/>behind while Boland seized a long cabbage stump which was 
                        <lb n="20779"/>lying in the gutter. Struggling and kicking under the cuts of the 
                        <lb n="20780"/>cane and the blows of the knotty stump Stephen was borne 
                        <lb n="20781"/>back against a barbed wire fence.

                    <lb n="20788"/><p>  At last after a fury of plunges he wrenched himself free. His 
                        <lb n="20789"/>tormentors set off towards <place><location><geo>53.360891 -6.251230</geo></location><placeName>Jones's Road</placeName></place>, laughing and jeering 
                        <lb n="20790"/>at him, while he, }omit{ half blinded with tears, stumbled on, clench- 
                        <lb n="20791"/>ing his fists madly and sobbing. </p>
                    <lb n="20792"/><p>  While he was still repeating the <seg xml:lang="la">Confiteor</seg> amid the indul- 
                        <lb n="20793"/>gent laughter of his hearers and while the scenes of that 
                        <lb n="20794"/>malignant episode were still passing sharply and swiftly before 
                        <lb n="20795"/>his mind he wondered why he bore no malice now to those 
                        <lb n="20796"/>who had tormented him. He had not forgotten a whit of their 
                        <lb n="20797"/>cowardice and cruelty but the memory of it called forth no 
                        <lb n="20798"/>anger from him. All the descriptions of fierce love and hatred 
                        <lb n="20799"/>which he had met in books had  seemed to him therefore unreal. 
                        <lb n="20800"/>Even that night as he stumbled homewards along <place><location><geo>53.360891 -6.251230</geo></location><placeName>Jones's Road</placeName></place> 
                        <lb n="20801"/>he had felt that some power was divesting him of that sudden- 
                        <lb n="20802"/>woven anger as easily as a fruit is divested of her soft ripe peel. </p>
                    <lb n="20803"/><p>  He remained standing with his two companions at the end 
                        <lb n="20804"/>of the shed, listening idly to their talk or to the bursts of 
                        <lb n="20805"/>applause in the theatre. She was sitting there among the others, 
                        <lb n="20806"/>perhaps waiting for him to appear. He tried to recall her ap- 
                        <lb n="20807"/>pearance but could not. He could remember only that she had 
                        <lb n="20808"/>worn a shawl about her head like a cowl and that her dark eyes 
                        <lb n="20809"/>had invited and unnerved him. He wondered had he been in her 
                        <lb n="20810"/>thoughts as she had been in his. Then in the dark and unseen 
                        <lb n="20811"/>by the other two he rested the tips of the fingers of one hand 
                        <lb n="20812"/>upon the palm of the other hand, scarcely touching it and yet 
                        <lb n="20813"/>pressing upon it lightly. But the pressure of her fingers had 
                        <lb n="20814"/>been lighter and steadier: and suddenly the memory of their 
                        <lb n="20815"/>touch traversed his brain and body like an invisible warm 
                        <lb n="20816"/>wave. </p>
                    <lb n="20817"/><p>  A boy came towards them, running along under the shed. 
                        <lb n="20818"/>He was excited and breathless. 
                        <lb n="20819"/><said who="a boy">―O, Dedalus, he cried, Doyle is in a great bake about you.

                    <lb n="20824"/><p>  The boy turned to Heron and repeated:

                        <lb n="20826"/><said who="Heron">―Will you tell Doyle with my best compliments that I damned 
                            <lb n="20827"/>his eyes? answered Heron.  </said>
                        <lb n="20828"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Well, I must go now, said Stephen who cared little for such 
                            <lb n="20829"/>points of honour.  </said>
                        <lb n="20830"/><said who="Heron">―I wouldn't, said Heron, damn me if I would. That's no way 
                            <lb n="20831"/>to send for one of the senior boys. In a bake, indeed! I think it's 
                            <lb n="20832"/>quite enough that you're taking a part in his bally old play. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="20833"/><p>  This spirit of quarrelsome comradeship which he had ob- 
                        <lb n="20834"/>served lately in his rival had not seduced Stephen from his 
                        <lb n="20835"/>habits of quiet obedience. He mistrusted the turbulence and 
                        <lb n="20836"/>doubted the sincerity of such comradeship which seemed to 
                        <lb n="20837"/>him a sorry anticipation of manhood. The question of honour 
                        <lb n="20838"/>here raised was, like all such questions, trivial to him. While his 
                        <lb n="20839"/>mind had been pursuing its intangible phantoms and turning in 
                        <lb n="20840"/>irresolution from such pursuit he had heard about him the 
                        <lb n="20841"/>constant voices of his father and of his masters, urging him to 
                        <lb n="20842"/>be a gentleman above all things and urging him to be a good 
                        <lb n="20843"/>catholic above all things. These voices had now come to be 
                        <lb n="20844"/>hollowsounding in his ears. When the gymnasium had been 
                        <lb n="20845"/>opened he had heard another voice urging him to be strong and 
                        <lb n="20846"/>manly and healthy and when the movement towards national 
                        <lb n="20847"/>revival had begun to be felt in the college yet another voice had 
                        <lb n="20848"/>bidden him  be true to his country and help to raise up her 
                        <lb n="20849"/>fallen language and tradition. In the profane world, as he 
                        <lb n="20850"/>foresaw, a worldly voice would bid him raise up his father's 
                        <lb n="20851"/>fallen state by his labours and, meanwhile, the voice of his 
                        <lb n="20852"/>schoolcomrades urged him to be a decent fellow, to shield 
                        <lb n="20853"/>others from blame or to beg them off and to do his best to get 
                        <lb n="20854"/>free days for the school. And it was the din of all these hollow- 
                        <lb n="20855"/>sounding voices that made him halt irresolutely in the pursuit 
                        <lb n="20856"/>of phantoms. He gave them ear only for a time but he was 
                        <lb n="20857"/>happy only when he was far from them, beyond their call, 
                        <lb n="20858"/>alone or in the company of phantasmal comrades. </p>
                    <lb n="20859"/><p>  In the vestry a plump freshfaced jesuit and an elderly man, in 
                        <lb n="20860"/>shabby blue clothes, were dabbling in a case of paints and 
                        <lb n="20861"/>chalks. The boys who had been painted walked about or stood 
                        <lb n="20862"/>still awkwardly, touching their faces in a gingerly fashion with 
                        <lb n="20863"/>their furtive fingertips. In the middle of the vestry a young 
                        <lb n="20864"/>jesuit, who was then on a visit to the college, stood rocking 
                        <lb n="20865"/>himself rhythmically from the tips of his toes to his heels and 
                        <lb n="20866"/>back again, his hands thrust well forward into his sidepockets. 
                        <lb n="20867"/>His small head set off with glossy red curls and his newly 
                        <lb n="20868"/>shaven face agreed well with the spotless decency of his soutane 
                        <lb n="20869"/>and with his spotless shoes. </p>
                    <lb n="20870"/><p>  As he watched this swaying form and tried to read for him- 
                        <lb n="20871"/>self the legend of the priest's mocking smile there came into 
                        <lb n="20872"/>Stephen's memory a saying which he had heard from his father 
                        <lb n="20873"/>before he had been sent to <place><location><geo>53.310770 -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>, that you could always 
                        <lb n="20874"/>tell a jesuit by the style of his clothes. At the same moment he 
                        <lb n="20875"/>thought he saw a likeness between his father's mind and that of 
                        <lb n="20876"/>this smiling welldressed priest: and he was aware of some des- 
                        <lb n="20877"/>ecration of the priest's office or of the vestry itself, whose si- 
                        <lb n="20878"/>lence was now routed by loud talk and joking and its air 
                        <lb n="20879"/>pungent with the smells of the gasjets and the grease. </p>
                    <lb n="20880"/><p>  While his forehead was being wrinkled and his jaws painted 
                        <lb n="20881"/>black and blue by the elderly man he listened distractedly to the 
                        <lb n="20882"/>voice of the plump young jesuit which bade him speak up and 
                        <lb n="20883"/>make his points clearly. He could hear the band playing <emph>The 
                            <lb n="20884"/>Lily of Killarney</emph> and knew that in a few moments the curtain 
                        <lb n="20885"/>would go up. He felt no stage fright but the thought of the part 
                        <lb n="20886"/>he had to play humiliated him. A remembrance  of some of his 
                        <lb n="20887"/>lines made a sudden flush rise to his painted cheeks. He saw her 
                        <lb n="20888"/>serious alluring eyes watching him from among the audience 
                        <lb n="20889"/>and their image at once swept away his scruples, leaving his 
                        <lb n="20890"/>will compact. Another nature seemed to have been lent him: 
                        <lb n="20891"/>the infection of the excitement and youth about him entered 
                        <lb n="20892"/>into and transformed his moody mistrustfulness. For one rare 
                        <lb n="20893"/>moment he seemed to be clothed in the real apparel of boy- 
                        <lb n="20894"/>hood: and, as he stood in the wings among the other players, he 
                        <lb n="20895"/>shared the common mirth amid which the drop scene was 
                        <lb n="20896"/>hauled upwards by two ablebodied priests with violent jerks 
                        <lb n="20897"/>and all awry. </p>
                    <lb n="20898"/><p>  A few moments after he found himself on the stage amid the 
                        <lb n="20899"/>garish gas and the dim scenery, acting before the innumerable 
                        <lb n="20900"/>faces of the void. It surprised him to see that the play which he 
                        <lb n="20901"/>had known at rehearsals for a disjointed lifeless thing had 
                        <lb n="20902"/>suddenly assumed a life of its own. It seemed now to play itself, 
                        <lb n="20903"/>he and his fellow actors aiding it with their parts. When the 
                        <lb n="20904"/>curtain fell on the last scene he heard the void filled with 
                        <lb n="20905"/>applause and, through a rift in the side scene, saw the simple 
                        <lb n="20906"/>body before which he had acted magically deformed, the void 
                        <lb n="20907"/>of faces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy 
                        <lb n="20908"/>groups. </p>
                    <lb n="20909"/><p>  He left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery 
                        <lb n="20910"/>and passed out through the chapel into the college garden. 
                        <lb n="20911"/>Now that the play was over his nerves cried for some further 
                        <lb n="20912"/>adventure. He hurried onwards as if to overtake it. The doors 
                        <lb n="20913"/>of the theatre were all open and the audience had emptied out. 
                        <lb n="20914"/>On the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an ark a few 
                        <lb n="20915"/>lanterns swung in the night breeze, flickering cheerlessly. He 
                        <lb n="20916"/>mounted the steps from the garden in haste, eager that some 
                        <lb n="20917"/>prey should not elude him, and forced his way through the 
                        <lb n="20918"/>crowd in the hall and past the two jesuits who stood watching 
                        <lb n="20919"/>the exodus and bowing and shaking hands with the visitors. He 
                        <lb n="20920"/>pushed onward nervously, feigning a still greater haste and 
                        <lb n="20921"/>faintly conscious of the smiles and stares and nudges which his 
                        <lb n="20922"/>powdered head left in its wake. </p>
                    <lb n="20923"/><p>  When he came out on the steps he saw his family waiting for 
                        <lb n="20924"/>him at the first lamp. In a glance he noted that every figure of 
                        <lb n="20925"/>the group was familiar and ran down the steps angrily. </p>
                    <p><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I have to leave a message down in George's Street,</said> he said to <lb n="20926"></lb>
                        his father quickly. <said who="Stephen Dedalus">I'll be home after you. <lb n="20927"></lb></said></p>
                    <lb n="20928"/><p>  Without waiting for his father's questions  he ran across the 
                        <lb n="20929"/>road and began to walk at breakneck speed down the hill. He 
                        <lb n="20930"/>hardly knew where he was walking. Pride and hope and desire 
                        <lb n="20931"/>like crushed herbs in his heart sent up vapours of maddening 
                        <lb n="20932"/>incense before the eyes of his mind. He strode down the hill 
                        <lb n="20933"/>amid the tumult of suddenrisen vapours of wounded pride and 
                        <lb n="20934"/>fallen hope and baffled desire. They streamed upwards before 
                        <lb n="20935"/>his anguished eyes in dense and maddening fumes and passed 
                        <lb n="20936"/>away above him till at last the air was clear and cold again. </p>
                    <lb n="20937"/><p>  A film still veiled his eyes but they burned no longer. A 
                        <lb n="20938"/>power, akin to that which had often made anger or resentment 
                        <lb n="20939"/>fall from him, brought his steps to rest. He stood still and 
                        <lb n="20940"/>gazed up at the sombre porch of the morgue and from that to 
                        <lb n="20941"/>the dark cobbled laneway at its side. He saw the word <emph>Lotts</emph> on 
                        <lb n="20942"/>the wall of the lane and breathed slowly the rank heavy air. </p>
                    <lb n="20943"/><p> ―That is horse piss and rotted straw, he thought. It is a good 
                        <lb n="20944"/>odour to breathe. It will calm my heart. My heart is quite calm 
                        <lb n="20945"/>now. I will go back. </p>

                    <lb n="20946"/><p>  Stephen was once again seated beside his father in the corner 
                        <lb n="20947"/>of a railway carriage at Kingsbridge. He was travelling with his 
                        <lb n="20948"/>father by the night mail to Cork. As the train steamed out of 
                        <lb n="20949"/>the station he recalled his childish wonder of years before and 
                        <lb n="20950"/>every event of his first day at <place><location><geo>53.310770 -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>. But he felt no wonder 
                        <lb n="20951"/>now. He saw the darkening lands slipping past him, the silent 
                        <lb n="20952"/>telegraphpoles passing his window swiftly every four seconds, 
                        <lb n="20953"/>the little glimmering stations, manned by a few silent sentries, 
                        <lb n="20954"/>flung by the mail behind her and twinkling for a moment in the 
                        <lb n="20955"/>darkness like fiery grains flung backwards by a runner. </p>
                    <lb n="20956"/><p>  He listened without sympathy to his father's evocation of 
                        <lb n="20957"/>Cork and of scenes of his youth, a tale broken by sighs or 
                        <lb n="20958"/>draughts from his pocket flask whenever the image of some 
                        <lb n="20959"/>dead friend appeared in it or whenever the evoker remembered 
                        <lb n="20960"/>suddenly the purpose of his actual visit. Stephen heard but 
                        <lb n="20961"/>could feel no pity. The images of the dead were all strange to 
                        <lb n="20962"/>him save that of uncle Charles, an image which had lately been 
                        <lb n="20963"/>fading out of memory. He knew, however, that his father's 
                        <lb n="20964"/>property was going to be sold by auction and in the manner of 
                        <lb n="20965"/>his own dispossession he felt the world give the lie rudely to his 
                        <lb n="20966"/>phantasy. </p>
                    <lb n="20967"/><p>  At Maryborough he fell asleep. When he awoke the train 
                        <lb n="20968"/>had passed out of Mallow and his father was stretched asleep 
                        <lb n="20969"/>on the other seat. The cold light of the dawn lay over the 
                        <lb n="20970"/>country, over the unpeopled fields and the closed cottages. The 
                        <lb n="20971"/>terror of sleep fascinated his mind as he watched the silent 
                        <lb n="20972"/>country or heard from time to time his father's deep breath or 
                        <lb n="20973"/>sudden sleepy movement. The neighbourhood of unseen 
                        <lb n="20974"/>sleepers filled him with strange dread as though they could 
                        <lb n="20975"/>harm him; and he prayed that the day might come quickly. His 
                        <lb n="20976"/>prayer, addressed neither to God nor saint, began with a shiver, 
                        <lb n="20977"/>as the chilly morning breeze crept through the chink of the 
                        <lb n="20978"/>carriage door to his feet, and ended in a trail of foolish words 
                        <lb n="20979"/>which he made to fit the insistent rhythm of the train: and 
                        <lb n="20980"/>silently, at intervals of four seconds, the telegraphpoles held the 
                        <lb n="20981"/>galloping notes of the music between punctual bars. This furi- 
                        <lb n="20982"/>ous music allayed his dread and, leaning against the window- 
                        <lb n="20983"/>ledge, he let his eyelids close again. </p>

                        <lb n="20985"/>morning and Stephen finished his sleep in a bedroom of the 
                        <lb n="20986"/>Victoria Hotel. The bright warm sunlight was streaming 
                        <lb n="20987"/>through the window and he could hear the din of traffic. His 
                        <lb n="20988"/>father was standing before the dressingtable, examining his 
                        <lb n="20989"/>hair and face and moustache with great care, craning his neck 
                        <lb n="20990"/>across the waterjug and drawing it back sideways to see the 
                        <lb n="20991"/>better. While he did so he sang softly to himself with quaint 
                        <lb n="20992"/>accent and phrasing:

                        <lb n="21010"/>dow and the tender tremors with which his father's voice 
                        <lb n="21011"/>festooned the strange sad happy air drove off all the mists of 
                        <lb n="21012"/>the night's ill humour from Stephen's brain. He got up quickly 
                        <lb n="21013"/>to dress and, when the song had ended, said:

                        <lb n="21016"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I like it, said Stephen.  </said>
                        <lb n="21017"/><said who="Simon Dedalus">―It's a pretty old air, said Mr Dedalus, twirling the points of 
                            <lb n="21018"/>his moustache. Ah, but you should have heard Mick Lacy sing 
                            <lb n="21019"/>it! Poor Mick Lacy! He had little turns for it, grace notes he 
                            <lb n="21020"/>used to put in that I haven't got. That was the boy }omit{ could sing a

                    <lb n="21022"/><p>  Mr Dedalus had ordered drisheens for breakfast and during 
                        <lb n="21023"/>the meal he crossexamined the waiter for local news. For the 
                        <lb n="21024"/>most part they spoke at cross purposes when a name was 
                        <lb n="21025"/>mentioned, the waiter having in mind its present holder and Mr 
                        <lb n="21026"/>Dedalus his father or perhaps his grandfather.

                            <lb n="21028"/>how, said Mr Dedalus, for I want to show it to this youngster 
                            <lb n="21029"/>of mine. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="21030"/><p>  Along the Mardyke the trees were in bloom. They entered 
                        <lb n="21031"/>the grounds of the college and were led by the garrulous porter 
                        <lb n="21032"/>across the quadrangle. But their progress across the gravel was 
                        <lb n="21033"/>brought to a halt after  every dozen or so paces by some reply of 
                        <lb n="21034"/>the porter's. 
                        <lb n="21035"/><said who="Simon Dedalus">―Ah, do you tell me so? And is poor Pottlebelly dead?  </said>
                        <lb n="21036"/><said who="porter">―Yes, sir. Dead, sir. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="21037"/><p>  During these halts Stephen stood awkwardly behind the two 
                        <lb n="21038"/>men, weary of the subject and waiting restlessly for the slow 
                        <lb n="21039"/>march to begin again. By the time they had crossed the quad- 
                        <lb n="21040"/>rangle his restlessness had risen to fever. He wondered how his 
                        <lb n="21041"/>father, whom he knew for a shrewd suspicious man, could be 
                        <lb n="21042"/>duped by the servile manners of the porter: and the lively 
                        <lb n="21043"/>southern speech which had entertained him all the morning 
                        <lb n="21044"/>now irritated his ears. </p>
                    <lb n="21045"/><p>  They passed into the anatomy theatre where Mr Dedalus, 
                        <lb n="21046"/>the porter aiding him, searched the desks for his initials. Ste- 
                        <lb n="21047"/>phen remained in the background, depressed more than ever by 
                        <lb n="21048"/>the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the air it wore of 
                        <lb n="21049"/>jaded and formal study. On the desk before him he read the 
                        <lb n="21050"/>word <emph>Foetus</emph>  cut several times in the dark stained wood. The 
                        <lb n="21051"/>sudden legend startled his blood: he seemed to feel the absent 
                        <lb n="21052"/>students of the college about him and to shrink from their 
                        <lb n="21053"/>company. A vision of their life, which his father's words had 
                        <lb n="21054"/>been powerless to evoke, sprang up before him out of the word 
                        <lb n="21055"/>cut in the desk. A broadshouldered student with a moustache 
                        <lb n="21056"/>was cutting in the letters with a jackknife, seriously. Other 
                        <lb n="21057"/>students stood or sat near him laughing at his handiwork. One 
                        <lb n="21058"/>jogged his elbow. The big student turned on him, frowning. He 
                        <lb n="21059"/>was dressed in loose grey clothes and had tan boots. </p>
                    <lb n="21060"/><p>  Stephen's name was called. He hurried down the steps of the 
                        <lb n="21061"/>theatre so as to be as far away from the vision as he could be 
                        <lb n="21062"/>and, peering closely at his father's initials, hid his flushed face. </p>
                    <lb n="21063"/><p>  But the word and the vision capered before his eyes as he 
                        <lb n="21064"/>walked back across the quadrangle and towards the college 
                        <lb n="21065"/>gate. It shocked him to find in the outer world a trace of what 
                        <lb n="21066"/>he had deemed till then a brutish and individual malady of his 
                        <lb n="21067"/>own mind. His recent monstrous reveries came thronging into 
                        <lb n="21068"/>his memory. They too had sprung up before him, suddenly and 
                        <lb n="21069"/>furiously, out of mere words. He had soon given in to them and 
                        <lb n="21070"/>allowed them to sweep across and abase his intellect, wonder- 
                        <lb n="21071"/>ing always where they came from, from what den of monstrous 
                        <lb n="21072"/>images, and always weak and humble towards others, restless 
                        <lb n="21073"/>and sickened of himself when they had swept over him. 
                        <lb n="21074"/><said who="Simon Dedalus">―Ay, bedad! And there's the Groceries sure enough! cried Mr 
                            <lb n="21075"/>Dedalus. You often heard me speak of the Groceries, didn't 
                            <lb n="21076"/>you, Stephen. Many's the time we went down there when our 
                            <lb n="21077"/>names had been marked, a crowd of us, Harry Peard and little 
                            <lb n="21078"/>Jack Mountain and Bob Dyas and Maurice Moriarty, the 
                            <lb n="21079"/>Frenchman, and Tom O'Grady and Mick Lacy that I told you 
                            <lb n="21080"/>of this morning and Joey Corbet and poor little goodhearted 
                            <lb n="21081"/>Johnny Keevers of the Tantiles. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="21082"/><p>  The leaves of the trees along the Mardyke were astir and 
                        <lb n="21083"/>whispering in the sunlight. A team of cricketers passed, agile 
                        <lb n="21084"/>young men in flannels and blazers, one of them carrying the 
                        <lb n="21085"/>long green wicketbag. In a quiet bystreet a German band of five 
                        <lb n="21086"/>players in faded uniforms and with battered brass instruments 
                        <lb n="21087"/>was playing to an audience of street arabs and leisurely mess- 
                        <lb n="21088"/>enger boys. A maid in a white cap and apron was watering a 
                        <lb n="21089"/>box of plants on a sill which shone like a slab of limestone in 
                        <lb n="21090"/>the warm glare. From another window open to the air came the 
                        <lb n="21091"/>sound of a piano, scale after scale rising into the treble. </p>
                    <lb n="21092"/><p>  Stephen walked on at his father's side, listening to stories he 
                        <lb n="21093"/>had heard before, hearing again the names of the scattered and 
                        <lb n="21094"/>dead revellers who had been the companions of his father's 
                        <lb n="21095"/>youth. And a faint sickness sighed in his heart. He recalled his 
                        <lb n="21096"/>own equivocal position in Belvedere, a free boy, a leader afraid 
                        <lb n="21097"/>of his own authority, proud and sensitive and suspicious, bat- 
                        <lb n="21098"/>tling against the squalor of his life and against the riot of his 
                        <lb n="21099"/>mind. The letters cut in the stained wood of the desk stared 
                        <lb n="21100"/>upon him, mocking his bodily weakness and futile enthusiasms 
                        <lb n="21101"/>and making him loathe himself for his own mad and filthy 
                        <lb n="21102"/>orgies. The spittle in his throat grew bitter and foul to swallow 
                        <lb n="21103"/>and the faint sickness climbed to his brain so that for a moment 
                        <lb n="21104"/>he closed his eyes and walked on in darkness. </p>
                    <lb n="21105"/><p>  He could still hear his father's voice. 
                        <lb n="21106"/><said who="Simon Dedalus">―When you kick out for yourself, Stephen, }omit{ (as I daresay you 
                            <lb n="21107"/>will one of those days) }omit{ remember, whatever you do, to mix 
                            <lb n="21108"/>with gentlemen. When I was a young fellow I tell you I enjoyed 
                            <lb n="21109"/>myself. I mixed with fine decent fellows. Everyone of us could 
                            <lb n="21110"/>do something. One fellow had a good voice, another fellow 
                            <lb n="21111"/>was a good actor, another could sing a good comic song, an- 
                            <lb n="21112"/>other was a good oarsman or a good racketplayer, another 
                            <lb n="21113"/>could tell a good story and so on. We kept the ball rolling 
                            <lb n="21114"/>anyhow and enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life and we 
                            <lb n="21115"/>were none the worse of it either. But we were all gentlemen, 
                            <lb n="21116"/>Stephen, (at least I hope we were) }omit{ and bloody good honest 
                            <lb n="21117"/>Irishmen too. That's the kind of fellows I want you to associate 
                            <lb n="21118"/>with, fellows of the right kidney. I'm talking to you as a friend, 
                            <lb n="21119"/>Stephen. I don't believe in playing the stern father. I don't 
                            <lb n="21120"/>believe a son should be afraid of his father. No, I treat you as 
                            <lb n="21121"/>your grandfather treated me when I was a young chap. We 
                            <lb n="21122"/>were more like brothers than father and son. I'll never forget 
                            <lb n="21123"/>the first day he caught me smoking. I was standing at the end 
                            <lb n="21124"/>of the South Terrace one day with some maneens like myself 
                            <lb n="21125"/>and sure we thought we were grand fellows because we had 
                            <lb n="21126"/>pipes stuck in the corners of our mouths. Suddenly the gov- 
                            <lb n="21127"/>ernor passed. He didn't say a word or stop even. But the next 
                            <lb n="21128"/>day, Sunday, we were out for a walk together and when we 
                            <lb n="21129"/>were coming home he took out his cigar case and said: <emph>By the 
                                <lb n="21130"/>bye, Simon, I didn't know you smoked:</emph> or something like that. 
                            <lb n="21131"/>– Of course I tried to carry it off as best I could. <emph>If you want a 
                                <lb n="21132"/>good smoke</emph>, he said, <emph>try one of these cigars. An American

                    <lb n="21138"/><p>  He heard the sob passing loudly down his father's throat 
                        <lb n="21139"/>and opened his eyes with a nervous impulse. The sunlight 
                        <lb n="21140"/>breaking suddenly on his sight turned the sky and clouds into a 
                        <lb n="21141"/>fantastic world of sombre masses with lakelike spaces of dark 
                        <lb n="21142"/>rosy light. His very brain was sick and powerless. He could 
                        <lb n="21143"/>scarcely interpret the letters of the signboards of the shops. By 
                        <lb n="21144"/>his monstrous way of life he seemed to have put himself be- 
                        <lb n="21145"/>yond the limits of reality. Nothing moved him or spoke to him 
                        <lb n="21146"/>from the real world unless he heard in it an echo of the 
                        <lb n="21147"/>infuriated cries within him. He could respond to no earthly or 
                        <lb n="21148"/>human appeal, dumb and insensible to the call of summer and 
                        <lb n="21149"/>gladness and companionship, wearied and dejected by his fa- 
                        <lb n="21150"/>ther's voice. He could scarcely recognise as his his own 
                        <lb n="21151"/>thoughts, and repeated slowly to himself: </p>
                    <lb n="21152"/><p> ―I am Stephen Dedalus. I am walking beside my father whose 
                        <lb n="21153"/>name is Simon Dedalus. We are in Cork, in Ireland. Cork is a 
                        <lb n="21154"/>city. Our room is in the Victoria Hotel. Victoria and Stephen 
                        <lb n="21155"/>and Simon. Simon and Stephen and Victoria. Names. </p>
                    <lb n="21156"/><p>  The memory of his childhood suddenly grew dim. He tried 
                        <lb n="21157"/>to call forth some of its vivid moments but could not. He 
                        <lb n="21158"/>recalled only names: Dante, Parnell, Clane, <place><location><geo>53.310770 -6.684719</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>. A little 
                        <lb n="21159"/>boy had been taught geography by an old woman who kept 
                        <lb n="21160"/>two brushes in her wardrobe. Then he had been sent away 
                        <lb n="21161"/>from home to a college. In the college he had made his first 
                        <lb n="21162"/>communion and eaten slim jim out of his cricket cap and 
                        <lb n="21163"/>watched the firelight leaping and dancing on the wall of a little 
                        <lb n="21164"/>bedroom in the infirmary and dreamed of being dead, of mass 
                        <lb n="21165"/>being said for him by the rector in a black and gold cope, of 
                        <lb n="21166"/>being buried then in the little graveyard of the community off 
                        <lb n="21167"/>the main avenue of limes. But he had not died then. Parnell had 
                        <lb n="21168"/>died. There had been no mass for the dead in the chapel and no 
                        <lb n="21169"/>procession. He had not died but he had faded out like a film in 
                        <lb n="21170"/>the sun. He had been lost or had wandered out of existence for 
                        <lb n="21171"/>he no longer existed. How strange to think of him passing out 
                        <lb n="21172"/>of existence in such a way, not by death but by fading out in 
                        <lb n="21173"/>the sun or by being lost and forgotten somewhere in the uni- 
                        <lb n="21174"/>verse! It was strange to see his small body appear again for a 
                        <lb n="21175"/>moment: a little boy in a grey belted suit. His hands were in his 
                        <lb n="21176"/>sidepockets and his trousers were tucked in at the  knees by 
                        <lb n="21177"/>elastic bands. </p>
                    <lb n="21178"/><p>  On the evening of the day on which the property was sold 
                        <lb n="21179"/>Stephen followed his father meekly about the city from bar to 
                        <lb n="21180"/>bar. To the sellers in the market, to the barmen and barmaids, 
                        <lb n="21181"/>to the beggars who importuned him for a lob Mr Dedalus told 
                        <lb n="21182"/>the same tale, that he was an old Corkonian, that he had been 
                        <lb n="21183"/>trying for thirty years to get rid of his Cork accent up in Dublin 
                        <lb n="21184"/>and that Peter Pickackafox beside him was his eldest son but 
                        <lb n="21185"/>that he was only a Dublin jackeen. </p>
                    <lb n="21186"/><p>  They had set out early in the morning from Newcombe's 
                        <lb n="21187"/>coffeehouse where Mr Dedalus' cup had rattled noisily against 
                        <lb n="21188"/>its saucer and Stephen had tried to cover that shameful sign of 
                        <lb n="21189"/>his father's drinkingbout of the night before by moving his 
                        <lb n="21190"/>chair and coughing. One humiliation had succeeded another: 
                        <lb n="21191"/>the false smiles of the market sellers, the curvettings and 
                        <lb n="21192"/>oglings of the barmaids with whom his father flirted, the com- 
                        <lb n="21193"/>pliments and encouraging words of his father's friends. They 
                        <lb n="21194"/>had told him that he had a great look of his grandfather and 
                        <lb n="21195"/>Mr Dedalus had agreed that he was an ugly likeness. They had 
                        <lb n="21196"/>unearthed traces of a Cork accent in his speech and made him 
                        <lb n="21197"/>admit that the Lee was a much finer river than the Liffey. One 
                        <lb n="21198"/>of them in order to put his Latin to the proof had made him 
                        <lb n="21199"/>translate short passages from Dilectus and asked him whether 
                        <lb n="21200"/>it was correct to say: <seg xml:lang="la">Tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis</seg> 
                        <lb n="21201"/>or <seg xml:lang="la">Tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis</seg>. Another, a brisk 
                        <lb n="21202"/>old man, whom Mr Dedalus called Johnny Cashman, had 
                        <lb n="21203"/>covered him with confusion by asking him to say which were 
                        <lb n="21204"/>prettier, the Dublin girls or the Cork girls. 
                        <lb n="21205"/><said who="Simon Dedalus">―He's not that way built, said Mr Dedalus. Leave him alone.

                        <lb n="21291"/>best education that money could buy. Mr Dedalus lingered in 
                        <lb n="21292"/>the hall gazing about him and up at the roof and telling Ste- 
                        <lb n="21293"/>phen, who urged him to come out, that they were standing in 
                        <lb n="21294"/>the house of commons of the old Irish parliament. 
                        <lb n="21295"/><said who="Simon Dedalus">―God help us!</said> he said piously. <said who="Simon Dedalus">To think of the men of those 
                            <lb n="21296"/>times, Stephen, Hely Hutchinson and Flood and Henry Grattan 
                            <lb n="21297"/>and Charles Kendal Bushe, and the noblemen we have now, 
                            <lb n="21298"/>leaders of the Irish people at home and abroad. Why, by God, 
                            <lb n="21299"/>they wouldn't be seen dead in a ten acre field with them. No, 
                            <lb n="21300"/>Stephen, old chap, I'm sorry to say that they are only as I roved 
                            <lb n="21301"/>out one fine May morning in the merry month of sweet July. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="21302"/><p>  A keen October wind was blowing round the bank. The 
                        <lb n="21303"/>three figures standing at the edge of the muddy path had 
                        <lb n="21304"/>pinched cheeks and watery eyes. Stephen looked at his thinly 
                        <lb n="21305"/>clad mother and remembered that a few days before he had 
                        <lb n="21306"/>seen a mantle priced at twenty guineas in the window of Bar- 
                        <lb n="21307"/>nardo's. 
                        <lb n="21398"/><said who="Simon Dedalus">―Well that's done, said Mr Dedalus.  </said>
                        <lb n="21309"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―We had better go to dinner, said Stephen. Where?  </said>
                        <lb n="21310"/><said who="Simon Dedalus">―Dinner? said Mr Dedalus. Well, I suppose we had better, 
                            <lb n="21311"/>what? </said>
                        <lb n="21312"/><said who="Mary Dedalus">―Some place that's not too dear, said Mrs Dedalus.  </said>
                        <lb n="21313"/><said who="Simon Dedalus">―Underdone's? </said>
                        <lb n="21314"/><said who="Mary Dedalus">―Yes. Some quiet place.  </said>
                        <lb n="21315"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Come along, said Stephen quickly. It doesn't matter about 
                            <lb n="21316"/>the dearness. </said> </p>
                    <lb n="21317"/><p>  He walked on before them with short nervous steps, smiling. 
                        <lb n="21318"/>They tried to keep up with him, smiling also at his eagerness. 
                        <lb n="21319"/><said who="Simon Dedalus">―Take it easy like a good young fellow, said his father. We're 
                            <lb n="21320"/>not out for the half mile, are we? </said> </p>
                    <lb n="21321"/><p>  For a swift season of merrymaking the money of his prizes 
                        <lb n="21322"/>ran through Stephen's  fingers. Great parcels of groceries and 
                        <lb n="21323"/>delicacies and dried fruits arrived from the city. Every day he 
                        <lb n="21324"/>drew up a bill of fare for the family and every night led a party 
                        <lb n="21325"/>of three or four to the theatre to see <emph>Ingomar</emph> or <emph>The Lady of 
                            <lb n="21326"/>Lyons</emph>. In his coat pockets he carried squares of Vienna choc- 
                        <lb n="21327"/>olate for his guests while his trousers' pockets bulged with 
                        <lb n="21328"/>masses of silver and copper coins. He bought presents for 
                        <lb n="21329"/>everyone, overhauled his room, wrote out resolutions, marshal- 
                        <lb n="21330"/>led his books up and down their shelves, pored upon all kinds 
                        <lb n="21331"/>of price lists, drew up a form of commonwealth for the 
                        <lb n="21332"/>household by which every member of it held some office, 
                        <lb n="21333"/>opened a loan bank for his family and pressed loans on willing 
                        <lb n="21334"/>borrowers so that he might have the pleasure of making out 
                        <lb n="21335"/>receipts and reckoning the interests on the sums lent. When he 
                        <lb n="21336"/>could do no more he drove up and down the city in trams. 
                        <lb n="21337"/>Then the season of pleasure came to an end. The pot of pink 
                        <lb n="21338"/>enamel paint gave out and the wainscot of his bedroom re- 
                        <lb n="21339"/>mained with its unfinished and illplastered coat. </p>
                    <lb n="21340"/><p>  His household returned to its usual way of life. His mother 
                        <lb n="21341"/>had no further occasion to upbraid him for squandering his 
                        <lb n="21342"/>money. He too returned to his old life at school and all his 
                        <lb n="21343"/>novel enterprises fell to pieces. The commonwealth fell, the 
                        <lb n="21344"/>loan bank closed its coffers and its books on a sensible loss, the 
                        <lb n="21345"/>rules of life which he had drawn about himself fell into desue- 
                        <lb n="21346"/>tude. </p>
                    <lb n="21347"/><p>  How foolish his aim had been! He had tried to build a 
                        <lb n="21348"/>breakwater of order and elegance against the sordid tide of life 
                        <lb n="21349"/>without him and to dam up, by rules of conduct and active 
                        <lb n="21350"/>interests and new filial relations, the powerful recurrence of the 
                        <lb n="21351"/>tides within him. Useless. From without as from within the 
                        <lb n="21352"/>waters had flowed over his barriers: their tides began once 
                        <lb n="21353"/>more to jostle fiercely above the crumbled mole. </p>
                    <lb n="21354"/><p>  He saw clearly too his own futile isolation. He had not gone 
                        <lb n="21355"/>one step nearer the lives he had sought to approach nor bridged 
                        <lb n="21356"/>the restless shame and rancour that divided him from father 
                        <lb n="21357"/>and mother and brother and sister. He felt that he was hardly 
                        <lb n="21358"/>of the one blood with them but stood to them rather in the 
                        <lb n="21359"/>mystical kinship of fosterage, fosterchild and fosterbrother. </p>
                    <lb n="21360"/><p>  He burned to appease the fierce longings of his heart before 
                        <lb n="21361"/>which everything else was idle and alien. He cared little that he 
                        <lb n="21362"/>was in mortal sin, that his life had grown to be a tissue of 
                        <lb n="21363"/>subterfuges and falsehood. Beside the savage desire within him 
                        <lb n="21364"/>to realise the enormities which he brooded on nothing was 
                        <lb n="21365"/>sacred. He bore cynically with the shameful details of his secret 
                        <lb n="21366"/>riots in which he exulted to defile with patience whatever im- 
                        <lb n="21367"/>age had attracted his eyes. By day and by night he moved 
                        <lb n="21368"/>among distorted images of the outer world. A figure that had 
                        <lb n="21369"/>seemed to him by day demure and innocent  came towards him 
                        <lb n="21370"/>by night through the winding darkness of sleep, her face trans- 
                        <lb n="21371"/>figured by a lecherous cunning, her eyes bright with brutish 
                        <lb n="21372"/>joy. Only the morning pained him with its dim memory of dark 
                        <lb n="21373"/>orgiastic riot, its keen and humiliating sense of transgression. </p>
                    <lb n="21374"/><p>  He returned to his wanderings. The veiled autumnal even- 
                        <lb n="21375"/>ings led him from street to street as they had led him years 
                        <lb n="21376"/>before along the quiet avenues of Blackrock. But no vision of 
                        <lb n="21377"/>trim front gardens or of kindly lights in the windows poured a 
                        <lb n="21378"/>tender influence upon him now. Only at times, in the pauses of 
                        <lb n="21379"/>his desire, when the luxury that was wasting him gave room to 
                        <lb n="21380"/>a softer languor, the image of Mercedes traversed the back- 
                        <lb n="21381"/>ground of his memory. He saw again the small white house and 
                        <lb n="21382"/>the garden of rosebushes on the road that led to the mountains 
                        <lb n="21383"/>and he remembered the sadly proud gesture of refusal which he 
                        <lb n="21384"/>was to make there, standing with her in the moonlit garden 
                        <lb n="21385"/>after years of estrangement and adventure. At those moments 
                        <lb n="21386"/>the soft speeches of Claude Melnotte rose to his lips and eased 
                        <lb n="21387"/>his unrest. A tender premonition touched him of the tryst he 
                        <lb n="21388"/>had then looked forward to and, in spite of the horrible reality 
                        <lb n="21389"/>which lay between his hope of then and now, of the holy 
                        <lb n="21390"/>encounter he had then imagined at which weakness and timid- 
                        <lb n="21391"/>ity and inexperience were to fall from him. </p>
                    <lb n="21392"/><p>  Such moments passed and the wasting fires of lust sprang up 
                        <lb n="21393"/>again. The verses passed from his lips and the inarticulate cries 
                        <lb n="21394"/>and the unspoken brutal words rushed forth from his brain to 
                        <lb n="21395"/>force a passage. His blood was in revolt. He wandered up and 
                        <lb n="21396"/>down the dark slimy streets peering into the gloom of lanes and 
                        <lb n="21397"/>doorways, listening eagerly for any sound. He moaned to him- 
                        <lb n="21398"/>self like some baffled prowling beast. He wanted to sin with 
                        <lb n="21399"/>another of his kind, to force another being to sin with him and 
                        <lb n="21400"/>to exult with her in sin. He felt some dark presence moving 
                        <lb n="21401"/>irresistibly upon him from the  darkness, a presence subtle and 
                        <lb n="21402"/>murmurous as a flood filling him wholly with itself. Its mur- 
                        <lb n="21403"/>mur besieged his ears like the murmur of some multitude in 
                        <lb n="21404"/>sleep; its subtle streams penetrated his being. His hands 
                        <lb n="21405"/>clenched convulsively and his teeth set together as he suffered 
                        <lb n="21406"/>the agony of its penetration. He stretched out his arms in the 
                        <lb n="21407"/>street to hold fast the frail swooning form that eluded him and 
                        <lb n="21408"/>incited him: and the cry that he had strangled for so long in his 
                        <lb n="21409"/>throat issued from his lips. It broke from him like a wail of 
                        <lb n="21410"/>despair from a hell of sufferers and died in a wail of furious 
                        <lb n="21411"/>entreaty, a cry for an iniquitous abandonment, a cry which was 
                        <lb n="21412"/>but the echo of an obscene scrawl which he had read on the 
                        <lb n="21413"/>oozing wall of a urinal. </p>
                    <lb n="21414"/><p>  He had wandered into a maze of narrow and dirty streets. 
                        <lb n="21415"/>From the foul laneways he heard bursts of hoarse riot and 
                        <lb n="21416"/>wrangling and the drawling of drunken singers. He walked 
                        <lb n="21417"/>onward, undismayed, wondering whether he had strayed into 
                        <lb n="21418"/>the quarter of the jews. Women and girls dressed in long vivid 
                        <lb n="21419"/>gowns traversed the street from house to house. They were 
                        <lb n="21420"/>leisurely and perfumed. A trembling seized him and his eyes 
                        <lb n="21421"/>grew dim. The yellow gasflames arose before his troubled vi- 
                        <lb n="21422"/>sion against the vapoury sky, burning as if before an altar. 
                        <lb n="21423"/>Before the doors and in the lighted halls groups were gathered, 
                        <lb n="21424"/>arrayed as for some rite. He was in another world: he had 
                        <lb n="21425"/>awakened from a slumber of centuries. </p>
                    <lb n="21426"/><p>  He stood still in the middle of the roadway, his heart clam- 
                        <lb n="21427"/>ouring against his bosom in a tumult. A young woman dressed 
                        <lb n="21428"/>in a long pink gown laid her hand on his arm to detain him and 
                        <lb n="21429"/>gazed into his face. She said gaily: 
                        <lb n="21430"/><said who="prostitute">―Good night, Willie dear! </said> </p>
                    <lb n="21431"/><p>  Her room was warm and lightsome. A huge doll sat with her 
                        <lb n="21432"/>legs apart in the copious easychair beside the bed. He tried to 
                        <lb n="21433"/>bid his tongue speak that he might seem at ease, watching her 
                        <lb n="21434"/>as she undid her gown, noting the proud conscious movements 
                        <lb n="21435"/>of her perfumed head. </p>
                    <lb n="21436"/><p>  As he stood silent in the middle of the room she came over 
                        <lb n="21437"/>to him and embraced him gaily and gravely. Her round arms 
                        <lb n="21438"/>held him firmly to her and he, seeing her face lifted to him in 
                        <lb n="21439"/>serious calm and feeling the warm calm rise and fall of her 
                        <lb n="21440"/>breast, all but burst into hysterical weeping. Tears of joy and 
                        <lb n="21441"/>relief shone in his delighted eyes and his lips parted though they 
                        <lb n="21442"/>would not speak. </p>
                    <lb n="21443"/><p>  She passed her tinkling hand through his hair, calling him a 
                        <lb n="21444"/>little rascal. </p>
                    <p><said who="prostitute">―Give me a kiss,</said> she said. <lb n="21445"></lb></p>
                    <lb n="21446"/><p>  His lips would not bend to kiss her. He wanted to be held 
                        <lb n="21447"/>firmly in her arms, to be caressed slowly, slowly, slowly. In her 
                        <lb n="21448"/>arms he felt that he had suddenly become strong and fearless 
                        <lb n="21449"/>and sure of himself. But his lips would not bend to kiss her. </p>
                    <lb n="21450"/><p>  With a sudden movement she bowed his head and joined her 
                        <lb n="21451"/>lips to his and he read the meaning of her movements in her 
                        <lb n="21452"/>frank uplifted eyes. It was too much for him. He closed his 
                        <lb n="21453"/>eyes, surrendering himself to her, body and mind, conscious of 
                        <lb n="21454"/>nothing in the world but the dark pressure of her softly parting 
                        <lb n="21455"/>lips. They pressed upon his brain as upon his lips as though 
                        <lb n="21456"/>they were the vehicle of a vague speech; and between them he 
                        <lb n="21457"/>felt an unknown and timid pressure, darker than the swoon of 
                        <lb n="21458"/>sin, softer than sound or odour. </p>

                    <lb n="30001"/><p> The swift December dusk had come tumbling clownishly after 
                        <lb n="30002"/>its dull day and as he stared through the dull square of the 
                        <lb n="30003"/>window of the schoolroom he felt his belly crave for its food. 
                        <lb n="30004"/>He hoped there would be stew for dinner, turnips and carrots 
                        <lb n="30005"/>and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in 
                        <lb n="30006"/>thick peppered flourfattened sauce. Stuff it into you, his belly 
                        <lb n="30007"/>counselled him. </p>
                    <lb n="30008"/><p> It would be a gloomy secret night. After early nightfall the 
                        <lb n="30009"/>yellow lamps would light up here and there the squalid quarter 
                        <lb n="30010"/>of the brothels. He would follow a devious course up and down 
                        <lb n="30011"/>the streets, circling always nearer and nearer in a tremor of fear 
                        <lb n="30012"/>and joy, until his feet led him suddenly round a dark corner. 
                        <lb n="30013"/>The whores would be just coming out of their houses making 
                        <lb n="30014"/>ready for the night, yawning lazily after their sleep and settling 
                        <lb n="30015"/>the hairpins in their clusters of hair. He would pass by them 
                        <lb n="30016"/>calmly waiting for a sudden movement of his own will or a 
                        <lb n="30017"/>sudden call to his sinloving soul from their soft perfumed flesh. 
                        <lb n="30018"/>Yet as he prowled in quest of that call his senses, stultified only 
                        <lb n="30019"/>by his desire, would note keenly all that wounded and shamed 
                        <lb n="30020"/>them, his eyes a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a 
                        <lb n="30021"/>photograph of two soldiers standing to attention or a gaudy 
                        <lb n="30022"/>playbill, his ears the drawling jargon of greeting: 
                        <lb n="30023"/><said who="a whore">―Hello, Bertie, any good in your mind? </said>
                        <lb n="30024"/><said who="a whore">―Is that you, pigeon? </said>
                        <lb n="30025"/><said who="a whore">―Number ten. Fresh Nelly is waiting on you. </said>
                        <lb n="30026"/><said who="a whore">―Goodnight, husband! Coming in to have a short time?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="30027"/><p> The equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread 
                        <lb n="30028"/>out a widening tail, eyed and starred like a peacock's: and 
                        <lb n="30029"/>when the eyes and stars of its indices had been eliminated be- 
                        <lb n="30030"/>gan slowly to fold itself together again. The indices appearing 
                        <lb n="30031"/>and disappearing were eyes opening and closing; the eyes 
                        <lb n="30032"/>opening and closing were stars being born and being quenched. 
                        <lb n="30033"/>The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary  mind outward to its 
                        <lb n="30034"/>verge and inward to its centre, a distant music accompanying 
                        <lb n="30035"/>him outward and inward. What music? The music came nearer 
                        <lb n="30036"/>and he recalled the words, the words of Shelley's fragment 
                        <lb n="30037"/>upon the moon wandering companionless, pale for weariness. 
                        <lb n="30038"/>The stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell 
                        <lb n="30039"/>through space. </p>
                    <lb n="30040"/><p> The dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon an- 
                        <lb n="30041"/>other equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread 
                        <lb n="30042"/>abroad its widening tail. It was his own soul going forth to 
                        <lb n="30043"/>experience, unfolding itself sin by sin, spreading abroad the 
                        <lb n="30044"/>balefire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself, fading 
                        <lb n="30045"/>slowly, quenching its own lights and fires. They were 
                        <lb n="30046"/>quenched: and the cold darkness filled chaos. </p>
                    <lb n="30047"/><p> A cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul. At his first 
                        <lb n="30048"/>violent sin he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and 
                        <lb n="30049"/>had feared to find his body or his soul maimed by the excess. 
                        <lb n="30050"/>Instead the vital wave had carried him on its bosom out of 
                        <lb n="30051"/>himself and back again when it receded: and no part of body or 
                        <lb n="30052"/>soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been established 
                        <lb n="30053"/>between them. The chaos in which his ardour extinguished 
                        <lb n="30054"/>itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself. He had 
                        <lb n="30055"/>sinned mortally not once but many times and he knew that, 
                        <lb n="30056"/>while he stood in danger of eternal damnation for the first sin 
                        <lb n="30057"/>alone, by every succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt and his 
                        <lb n="30058"/>punishment. His days and works and thoughts could make no 
                        <lb n="30059"/>atonement for him, the fountains of sanctifying grace having 
                        <lb n="30060"/>ceased to refresh his soul. At most by an alms given to a 
                        <lb n="30061"/>beggar, whose blessing he fled from, he might hope wearily to 
                        <lb n="30062"/>win for himself some measure of actual grace. Devotion had 
                        <lb n="30063"/>gone by the board. What did it avail to pray when he knew that 
                        <lb n="30064"/>his soul lusted after its own destruction? A certain pride, a 
                        <lb n="30065"/>certain awe, withheld him from offering to God even one 
                        <lb n="30066"/>prayer at night though he knew it was in God's power to take 
                        <lb n="30067"/>away his life while he slept and hurl his soul hellward ere he 
                        <lb n="30068"/>could beg for mercy. His pride in his own sin, his loveless awe 
                        <lb n="30069"/>of God told him that his offence was too grievous to be atoned 
                        <lb n="30070"/>for in whole or in part by a false homage to the Allseeing and 
                        <lb n="30071"/>Allknowing. <said who="a voice">―Well now, Ennis, I declare you have a head and so has my 
                            <lb n="30073"/>stick! Do you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what 
                            <lb n="30074"/>a surd is?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="30075"/><p> The blundering answer stirred the embers of his contempt of 
                        <lb n="30076"/>his fellows. Towards others he felt neither shame nor fear. On 
                        <lb n="30077"/>Sunday mornings as he passed the churchdoor he glanced 
                        <lb n="30078"/>coldly at the worshippers who stood bareheaded, four deep, 
                        <lb n="30079"/>outside the church, morally present at the mass which they 
                        <lb n="30080"/>could neither see nor hear. Their dull piety and the sickly smell 
                        <lb n="30081"/>of the cheap hairoil with which they had anointed their heads 
                        <lb n="30082"/>repelled him from the altar they prayed at. He stooped to the 
                        <lb n="30083"/>evil of hypocrisy with others, sceptical of their innocence which 
                        <lb n="30084"/>he could cajole so easily. </p>
                    <lb n="30085"/><p> On the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll, the 
                        <lb n="30086"/>certificate of his prefecture in the college of the sodality of the 
                        <lb n="30087"/>Blessed Virgin Mary. On Saturday mornings when the sodality 
                        <lb n="30088"/>met in the chapel to recite the little office his place was a 
                        <lb n="30089"/>cushioned kneelingdesk at the right of the altar from which he 
                        <lb n="30090"/>led his wing of boys through the responses. The falsehood of 
                        <lb n="30091"/>his position did not pain him. If at moments he felt an impulse 
                        <lb n="30092"/>to rise from his post of honour and, confessing before them all 
                        <lb n="30093"/>his unworthiness, to leave the chapel, a glance at their faces 
                        <lb n="30094"/>restrained him. The imagery of the psalms of prophecy soothed 
                        <lb n="30095"/>his barren pride. The glories of Mary held his soul captive: 
                        <lb n="30096"/>spikenard and myrrh and frankincense, symbolising the 
                        <lb n="30097"/>preciousness of God's gifts to her soul, rich garments, symbol- 
                        <lb n="30098"/>ising her royal lineage, her emblems, the lateflowering plant 
                        <lb n="30099"/>and lateblossoming tree, symbolising the agelong gradual 
                        <lb n="30100"/>growth of her cultus among men. When it fell to him to read 
                        <lb n="30101"/>the lesson towards the close of the office he read it in a veiled 
                        <lb n="30102"/>voice, lulling his conscience to its music: </p>
                    <lg>
                        <lb n="30103"/><p> <emph>Quasi cedrus exaltata sum in Libanon et quasi cu- 
                                <lb n="30104"/>pressus in  monte Sion. Quasi palma exaltata sum in 
                                <lb n="30105"/>Gades et quasi  plantatio rosae in Jericho. Quasi uliva 
                                <lb n="30106"/>speciosa in campis et  quasi platanus exaltata sum juxta 
                                <lb n="30107"/>aquam in plateis. Sicut  cinnamomum et balsamum aro- 
                                <lb n="30108"/>matizans odorem dedi et quasi  myrrha electa dedi 
                                <lb n="30109"/>suavitatem odoris.</emph> </p>
                    </lg>
                    <lb n="30110"/><p> His sin, which had covered him from the sight of God, had 
                        <lb n="30111"/>led him nearer to the refuge of sinners. Her eyes seemed to 
                        <lb n="30112"/>regard him with mild pity; her holiness, a strange light glowing 
                        <lb n="30113"/>faintly upon her frail flesh, did not humiliate the sinner who 
                        <lb n="30114"/>approached her. If ever he was impelled to cast sin from him 
                        <lb n="30115"/>and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be 
                        <lb n="30116"/>her knight. If ever his soul, reentering her dwelling shyly after 
                        <lb n="30117"/>the frenzy of his body's lust had spent itself, was turned to- 
                        <lb n="30118"/>wards her whose emblem is the morning star, <emph>bright and</emph> 
                        <lb n="30119"/><emph>musical, telling of heaven and infusing peace</emph>, it was when her 
                        <lb n="30120"/>names were murmured softly by lips whereon there still lin- 
                        <lb n="30121"/>gered foul and shameful words, the savour itself of a lewd kiss. </p>
                    <lb n="30122"/><p> That was strange. He tried to think how it could be but the 
                        <lb n="30123"/>dusk, deepening in the schoolroom, covered over his thought. 
                        <lb n="30124"/>The bell rang. The master marked the sums and cuts to be done 
                        <lb n="30125"/>for the next lesson and went out. Heron, beside Stephen, began 
                        <lb n="30126"/>to hum tunelessly: </p>
                    <lb n="30127"/><p> <emph>My excellent friend Bombados.</emph> 
                        <lb n="30128"/><p> Ennis, who had gone to the yard, came back, saying: 
                            <lb n="30129"/><said who="Ennis">―The boy from the house is coming up for the rector.</said> </p>
                        <lb n="30130"/>A tall boy behind Stephen rubbed his hands and said: 
                        <lb n="30131"/><said who="a tall boy">―That's game ball. We can scut the whole hour. He won't be 
                            <lb n="30132"/>in till after half two. Then you can ask him questions on the 
                            <lb n="30133"/>catechism, Dedalus.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="30134"/><p> Stephen, leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler, 
                        <lb n="30135"/>listened to the talk about him which Heron checked from time 
                        <lb n="30136"/>to time by saying: 
                        <lb n="30137"/><said who="Vincent Heron">―Shut up, will you. Don't make such a bally racket!</said> </p>
                    <lb n="30138"/><p>It was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in follow- 
                        <lb n="30139"/>ing up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church 
                        <lb n="30140"/>and penetrating into obscure silences  only to hear and feel the 
                        <lb n="30141"/>more deeply his own condemnation. The sentence of saint 
                        <lb n="30142"/>James which says that he who offends against one command- 
                        <lb n="30143"/>ment becomes guilty of all had seemed to him first a swollen 
                        <lb n="30144"/>phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own 
                        <lb n="30145"/>state. From the evil seed of lust all other deadly sins had sprung 
                        <lb n="30146"/>forth: pride in himself and contempt of others, covetousness in 
                        <lb n="30147"/>using money for the purchase of unlawful pleasure, envy of 
                        <lb n="30148"/>those whose vices he could not reach to and calumnious 
                        <lb n="30149"/>murmuring against the pious, gluttonous  enjoyment of food, 
                        <lb n="30150"/>the dull glowering anger amid which he brooded upon his 
                        <lb n="30151"/>longing, the swamp of spiritual and bodily sloth in which his 
                        <lb n="30152"/>whole being had sunk. </p>

                        <lb n="30154"/>harsh face his mind wound itself in and out of the curious 
                        <lb n="30155"/>questions proposed to it. If a man had stolen a pound in his

                        <lb n="30157"/>much was he obliged to give back, the pound he had stolen 
                        <lb n="30158"/>only or the pound together with the compound interest accru- 
                        <lb n="30159"/>ing upon it or all his huge fortune? If a layman in giving

                        <lb n="30161"/>baptised? Is baptism with a mineral water valid? How comes it 
                        <lb n="30162"/>that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven 
                        <lb n="30163"/>to the poor of heart the second beatitude promises also to the 
                        <lb n="30164"/>meek that they shall possess the land? Why was the sacrament 
                        <lb n="30165"/>of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and 
                        <lb n="30166"/>wine if Jesus Christ be present body and blood, soul and divin- 
                        <lb n="30167"/>ity, in the bread alone and in the wine alone? Does a tiny

                        <lb n="30169"/>blood of Jesus Christ or a part only of the body and blood? If

                        <lb n="30175"/>from the house. All the catechisms were opened and all heads 
                        <lb n="30176"/>bent upon them silently. The rector entered and took his seat 
                        <lb n="30177"/>on the dais. A gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind 
                        <lb n="30178"/>urged Stephen to ask a difficult question. </p>
                    <lb n="30179"/><p> The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson 
                        <lb n="30180"/>from. He clasped his hands on the desk and said: 
                        <lb n="30181"/><said who="Father Conmee">―The retreat will begin on Wednesday afternoon in honour of 
                            <lb n="30182"/>saint Francis Xavier whose feast day is Saturday. The retreat 
                            <lb n="30183"/>will go on from Wednesday to Friday. On Friday confessions 
                            <lb n="30184"/>will be heard all the afternoon after beads. If any boys have 
                            <lb n="30185"/>special confessors perhaps it will be better for them not to 
                            <lb n="30186"/>change. Mass will be on Saturday morning at nine o'clock and 
                            <lb n="30187"/>general communion for the whole college. Saturday will be a 
                            <lb n="30188"/>free day. Sunday of course. But Saturday and Sunday being free 
                            <lb n="30189"/>days some boys might be inclined to think that Monday is a 
                            <lb n="30190"/>free day also. Beware of making that mistake. I think you, 
                            <lb n="30191"/>Lawless, are likely to make that mistake. </said>

                        <lb n="30194"/>boys from the rector's grim smile. Stephen's heart began slowly 
                        <lb n="30195"/>to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower. </p>

                            <lb n="30206"/>know, the apostle of the Indies. He went from country to 
                            <lb n="30207"/>country in the east, from Africa to India, from India to Japan, 
                            <lb n="30208"/>baptising the people. He is said to have baptised as many as ten 
                            <lb n="30209"/>thousand idolaters in one month. It is said that his right arm

                            <lb n="30274"/>world, in order to examine the state of our conscience, to 
                            <lb n="30275"/>reflect on the mysteries of holy religion and to understand 
                            <lb n="30276"/>better why we are here in this world. During these few days I 
                            <lb n="30277"/>intend to put before you some thoughts concerning the four 
                            <lb n="30278"/>last things. They are, as you know from your catechism, death, 
                            <lb n="30279"/>judgment, hell and heaven. We shall try to understand them 
                            <lb n="30280"/>fully during these few days so that we may derive from the 
                            <lb n="30281"/>understanding of them a lasting benefit to our souls. And re- 
                            <lb n="30282"/>member, my dear boys, that we have been sent into this world 
                            <lb n="30283"/>for one thing and for one thing alone: to do God's holy will 
                            <lb n="30284"/>and to save our immortal souls. All else is worthless. One thing 
                            <lb n="30285"/>alone is needful, the salvation of one's soul. What doth it profit 
                            <lb n="30286"/>a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his 
                            <lb n="30287"/>immortal soul? Ah, my dear boys, believe me there is nothing in

                            <lb n="30306"/>with joy and thankfulness and give thanks to God for having 
                            <lb n="30307"/>granted you this occasion of laying the first foundation of a 
                            <lb n="30308"/>pious honourable zealous christian life. And if, as may so 
                            <lb n="30309"/>happen, there be at this moment in these benches any poor soul 
                            <lb n="30310"/>which has had the unutterable misfortune to lose God's holy 
                            <lb n="30311"/>grace and to fall into grievous sin I fervently trust and pray that 
                            <lb n="30312"/>this retreat may be the turningpoint in the life of that soul. I 
                            <lb n="30313"/>pray to God  through the merits of His zealous servant Francis 
                            <lb n="30314"/>Xavier that such a soul may be led to sincere repentance and 
                            <lb n="30315"/>that the holy communion on saint Francis' day of this year may 
                            <lb n="30316"/>be a lasting covenant between God and that soul. For just and 
                            <lb n="30317"/>unjust, for saint and sinner alike, may this retreat be a mem- 
                            <lb n="30318"/>orable one. </said>

                            <lb n="30321"/>meanour. Banish from your minds all worldly thoughts and 
                            <lb n="30322"/>think only of the last things, death, judgment, hell and heaven. 
                            <lb n="30323"/>He who remembers these things, says Ecclesiastes, shall not sin 
                            <lb n="30324"/>for ever. He who remembers the last things will act and think

                    <lb n="30332"/><p> As he walked home with silent companions a thick fog 
                        <lb n="30333"/>seemed to compass his mind. He waited in stupor of mind till it 
                        <lb n="30334"/>should lift and reveal what it had hidden. He ate his dinner 
                        <lb n="30335"/>with surly appetite and, when the meal was over and the 
                        <lb n="30336"/>greasestrewn plates lay abandoned on the table, he rose and 
                        <lb n="30337"/>went to the window, clearing the thick scum from his mouth 
                        <lb n="30338"/>with his tongue and licking it from his lips. So he had sunk to 
                        <lb n="30339"/>the state of a beast that licks his chaps after meat. This was the 
                        <lb n="30340"/>end: and a faint glimmer of fear began to pierce the fog of his 
                        <lb n="30341"/>mind. He pressed his face against the pane of the window and 
                        <lb n="30342"/>gazed out into the darkening street. Forms passed this way and 
                        <lb n="30343"/>that way through the dull light. And that was life. The letters 
                        <lb n="30344"/>of the name of Dublin lay heavily upon his mind, pushing one 
                        <lb n="30345"/>another surlily hither and thither with slow boorish insistence. 
                        <lb n="30346"/>His soul was fattening and congealing into a gross grease, 
                        <lb n="30347"/>plunging ever deeper in its dull fear into a sombre threatening 
                        <lb n="30348"/>dusk, while the body that was his stood, listless and dishon- 
                        <lb n="30349"/>oured, gazing out of darkened eyes, helpless, perturbed and 
                        <lb n="30350"/>human for a bovine god to stare upon. </p>
                    <lb n="30351"/><p> The next day brought death and judgment, stirring his soul 
                        <lb n="30352"/>slowly from its listless despair. The faint glimmer of fear be- 
                        <lb n="30353"/>came a terror of spirit as the hoarse voice of the preacher blew 
                        <lb n="30354"/>death into his soul. He suffered its agony. He felt the deathchill 
                        <lb n="30355"/>touch the extremities and creep onward towards the heart, the 
                        <lb n="30356"/>film of death veiling the eyes, the bright centres of the brain 
                        <lb n="30357"/>extinguished one by one like lamps, the last sweat oozing upon 
                        <lb n="30358"/>the skin, the powerlessness of the dying limbs, the speech 
                        <lb n="30359"/>thickening and wandering and failing, the heart throbbing 
                        <lb n="30360"/>faintly and more faintly, all but vanquished, the breath, the 
                        <lb n="30361"/>poor timid breath, the poor helpless human spirit, sobbing and 
                        <lb n="30362"/>sighing, gurgling  and rattling in the throat. No help! No help! 
                        <lb n="30363"/>He, he himself, his body to which he had yielded was dying. 
                        <lb n="30364"/>Into the grave with it! Nail it down into a wooden box, the 
                        <lb n="30365"/>corpse. Carry it out of the house on the shoulders of hirelings. 
                        <lb n="30366"/>Thrust it out of men's sight into a long hole in the ground, into 
                        <lb n="30367"/>the grave, to rot, to feed the mass of its creeping worms and to 
                        <lb n="30368"/>be devoured by scuttling plumpbellied rats. </p>
                    <lb n="30369"/><p> And while the friends were still standing in tears by the 
                        <lb n="30370"/>bedside the soul of the sinner was judged. At the last moment 
                        <lb n="30371"/>of consciousness the whole earthly life passed before the vision 
                        <lb n="30372"/>of the soul and, ere it had time to reflect, the body had died and 
                        <lb n="30373"/>the soul stood terrified before the judgmentseat. God, who had 
                        <lb n="30374"/>long been merciful, would then be just. He had long been 
                        <lb n="30375"/>patient, pleading with the sinful soul, giving it time to repent, 
                        <lb n="30376"/>sparing it yet awhile. But that time had gone. Time was to sin 
                        <lb n="30377"/>and to enjoy, time was to scoff at God and at  the warnings of 
                        <lb n="30378"/>His holy church, time was to defy His majesty, to disobey His 
                        <lb n="30379"/>commands, to hoodwink one's fellow men, to commit sin after 
                        <lb n="30380"/>sin and sin after sin and to hide one's corruption from the sight 
                        <lb n="30381"/>of men. But that time was over. Now it was God's turn: and He 
                        <lb n="30382"/>was not to be hoodwinked or deceived. Every sin would then 
                        <lb n="30383"/>come forth from its lurkingplace, the most rebellious against 
                        <lb n="30384"/>the divine will and the most degrading to our poor corrupt 
                        <lb n="30385"/>nature, the tiniest imperfection and the most heinous atrocity. 
                        <lb n="30386"/>What did it avail then to have been a great emperor, a great 
                        <lb n="30387"/>general, a marvellous inventor, the most learned of the learned? 
                        <lb n="30388"/>All were as one before the judgmentseat of God. He would 
                        <lb n="30389"/>reward the good and punish the wicked. One single instant was 
                        <lb n="30390"/>enough for the trial of a man's soul. One single instant after the 
                        <lb n="30391"/>body's death, the soul had been weighed in the balance. The 
                        <lb n="30392"/>particular judgment was over and the soul had passed to the 
                        <lb n="30393"/>abode of bliss or to the prison of purgatory or had been hurled 
                        <lb n="30394"/>howling into hell. </p>
                    <lb n="30395"/><p> Nor was that all. God's justice had still to be vindicated 
                        <lb n="30396"/>before men: after the particular there still remained the general 
                        <lb n="30397"/>judgment. The last day had come. The doomsday was at hand. 
                        <lb n="30398"/>The stars of heaven were falling upon the earth like the figs 
                        <lb n="30399"/>cast by the figtree which the wind has shaken. The sun, the 
                        <lb n="30400"/>great luminary of the universe, had become as sackcloth of 
                        <lb n="30401"/>hair. The moon was bloodred. The firmament was as a scroll 
                        <lb n="30402"/>rolled away. The archangel Michael, the prince of the heavenly 
                        <lb n="30403"/>host, appeared glorious and terrible against the sky. With one 
                        <lb n="30404"/>foot on the sea and one foot on the land he blew from the 
                        <lb n="30405"/>archangelical trumpet the brazen death of time. The three 
                        <lb n="30406"/>blasts of the angel filled all the universe. Time is, time was but 
                        <lb n="30407"/>time shall be no more. At the last blast the souls of universal 
                        <lb n="30408"/>humanity throng towards the valley of Jehoshaphat, rich and 
                        <lb n="30409"/>poor, gentle and simple, wise and foolish, good and wicked. 
                        <lb n="30410"/>The soul of every human being that has ever existed, the souls 
                        <lb n="30411"/>of all those who shall yet be born, all the sons and daughters of 
                        <lb n="30412"/>Adam, all are assembled on that supreme day. And lo the 
                        <lb n="30413"/>supreme judge is coming! No longer the lowly Lamb of God, 
                        <lb n="30414"/>no longer the meek Jesus of Nazareth, no longer the Man of 
                        <lb n="30415"/>Sorrows, no longer the Good Shepherd,  He is seen now coming 
                        <lb n="30416"/>upon the clouds, in great power and majesty, attended by nine 
                        <lb n="30417"/>choirs of angels, angels and archangels, principalities, powers 
                        <lb n="30418"/>and virtues, thrones and dominations, cherubim and seraphim, 
                        <lb n="30419"/>God Omnipotent, God Everlasting. He speaks: and His voice is 
                        <lb n="30420"/>heard even at the farthest limits of space, even in the bottom- 
                        <lb n="30421"/>less abyss. Supreme Judge, from His sentence there will be and 
                        <lb n="30422"/>can be no appeal. He calls the just to His side bidding them 
                        <lb n="30423"/>enter into the kingdom, the eternity of bliss prepared for them. 
                        <lb n="30424"/>The unjust He casts from Him, crying in His offended majesty: 
                        <lb n="30425"/><emph>Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire which was</emph> 
                        <lb n="30426"/><emph>prepared for the devil and his angels.</emph> O what agony then for 
                        <lb n="30427"/>the miserable sinners! Friend is torn apart from friend, children are torn 
                        <lb n="30428"/>from their parents, husbands from their wives. The poor sinner 
                        <lb n="30429"/>holds out his arms to those who were dear and near to him in 
                        <lb n="30430"/>this earthly world, to those whose simple piety perhaps he 
                        <lb n="30431"/>made a mock of, to those who counselled him and tried to lead 
                        <lb n="30432"/>him on the right path, to a kind brother, to a loving sister, to 
                        <lb n="30433"/>the mother and father who loved him so dearly. But it is too 
                        <lb n="30434"/>late: the just turn away from the wretched damned souls which 
                        <lb n="30435"/>now appear before the eyes of all in their hideous and evil 
                        <lb n="30436"/>character. O you hypocrites, O you whited sepulchres, O you 
                        <lb n="30437"/>who present a smooth smiling face to the world while your soul 
                        <lb n="30438"/>within is a foul swamp of sin, how will it fare with you in that 
                        <lb n="30439"/>terrible day? </p>
                    <lb n="30440"/><p> And this day will come, shall come, must come: the day of 
                        <lb n="30441"/>death and the day of judgment. It is appointed unto man to die 
                        <lb n="30442"/>and after death the judgment. Death is certain. The time and 
                        <lb n="30443"/>manner are uncertain,  whether from long disease or from some 
                        <lb n="30444"/>unexpected accident: the Son of God cometh at an hour when 
                        <lb n="30445"/>you little expect Him. Be therefore ready every moment, seeing 
                        <lb n="30446"/>that you may die at any moment. Death is the end of us all. 
                        <lb n="30447"/>Death and judgment, brought into the world by the sin of our 
                        <lb n="30448"/>first parents, are the dark portals that close our earthly exist- 
                        <lb n="30449"/>ence, the portals that open into the unknown and the unseen, 
                        <lb n="30450"/>portals through which every soul must pass, alone, unaided 
                        <lb n="30451"/>save by its good works, without friend or  brother or parents or 
                        <lb n="30452"/>master to help it, alone and trembling. Let that thought be ever 
                        <lb n="30453"/>before our minds and then we cannot sin. Death, a cause of 
                        <lb n="30454"/>terror to the sinner, is a blessed moment for him who has 
                        <lb n="30455"/>walked in the right path, fulfilling the duties of his station in 
                        <lb n="30456"/>life, attending to his morning and evening prayers, approaching 
                        <lb n="30457"/>the holy sacrament frequently and performing good and mer- 
                        <lb n="30458"/>ciful works. For the pious and believing catholic, for the just 
                        <lb n="30459"/>man, death is no cause of terror. Was it not Addison, the great 
                        <lb n="30460"/>English writer, who, when on his deathbed, sent for the wicked 
                        <lb n="30461"/>young earl of Warwick to let him see how a christian can meet 
                        <lb n="30462"/>his end? He it is and he alone, the pious and believing christian, 
                        <lb n="30463"/>who can say in his heart: </p>
                    <lg>
                        <lb n="30464"/>O grave, where is thy victory?

                    <lb n="30466"/><p> Every word of it was for him. Against his sin, foul and 
                        <lb n="30467"/>secret, the whole wrath of God was aimed. The preacher's 
                        <lb n="30468"/>knife had probed deeply into his diseased conscience and he felt 
                        <lb n="30469"/>now that his soul was festering in sin. Yes, the preacher was 
                        <lb n="30470"/>right. God's turn had come. Like a beast in its lair his soul had 
                        <lb n="30471"/>lain down in its own filth but the blasts of the angel's trumpet 
                        <lb n="30472"/>had driven him forth from the darkness of sin into the light. 
                        <lb n="30473"/>The words of doom cried by the angel shattered in an instant 
                        <lb n="30474"/>his presumptuous peace. The wind of the last day blew through 
                        <lb n="30475"/>his mind; his sins, the jeweleyed harlots of his imagination, fled 
                        <lb n="30476"/>before the hurricane, squeaking like mice in their terror and 
                        <lb n="30477"/>huddled under a mane of hair. </p>
                    <lb n="30478"/><p> As he crossed the square, walking homeward, the light 
                        <lb n="30479"/>laughter of a girl reached his burning ears. The frail gay sound 
                        <lb n="30480"/>smote his heart more strongly than a trumpetblast, and, not 
                        <lb n="30481"/>daring to lift his eyes, he turned aside and gazed, as he walked, 
                        <lb n="30482"/>into the shadow of the tangled shrubs. Shame rose from his 
                        <lb n="30483"/>smitten heart and flooded his whole being. The image of Emma 
                        <lb n="30484"/>appeared before him and, under her eyes, the flood of shame 
                        <lb n="30485"/>rushed forth anew from his heart. If she knew to what his mind 
                        <lb n="30486"/>had subjected her or how his brutelike lust had torn and 
                        <lb n="30487"/>trampled upon her innocence! Was that boyish love? Was that 
                        <lb n="30488"/>chivalry? Was that poetry? The sordid details of his orgies stank 
                        <lb n="30489"/>under his very nostrils: the sootcoated packet of pictures which 
                        <lb n="30490"/>he had hidden in the flue of the fireplace and in the presence of 
                        <lb n="30491"/>whose shameless or bashful  wantonness he lay for hours sin- 
                        <lb n="30492"/>ning in thought and deed: his monstrous dreams, peopled by 
                        <lb n="30493"/>apelike creatures and by harlots with gleaming jewel eyes: the 
                        <lb n="30494"/>foul long letters he had written in the joy of guilty confession 
                        <lb n="30495"/>and carried secretly for days and days only to throw them 
                        <lb n="30496"/>under cover of night among the grass in the corner of a field or 
                        <lb n="30497"/>beneath some hingeless door or in some niche in the hedges 
                        <lb n="30498"/>where a girl might come upon them as she walked by and read 
                        <lb n="30499"/>them secretly. Mad! Mad! Was it possible he had done these 
                        <lb n="30500"/>things? A cold sweat broke out upon his forehead as the foul 
                        <lb n="30501"/>memories condensed within his brain. </p>
                    <lb n="30502"/><p> When the agony of shame had passed from him he tried to 
                        <lb n="30503"/>raise his soul from its abject powerlessness. God and the 
                        <lb n="30504"/>Blessed Virgin were too far from him: God was too great and 
                        <lb n="30505"/>stern and the Blessed Virgin too pure and holy. But he imagined 
                        <lb n="30506"/>that he stood near Emma in a wide land and,  humbly  and in 
                        <lb n="30507"/>tears, bent and kissed the elbow of her sleeve. </p>
                    <lb n="30508"/><p> In a wide land under a tender lucid evening sky, a cloud 
                        <lb n="30509"/>drifting westward amid a pale green sea of heaven, they stood 
                        <lb n="30510"/>together, children that had  erred. Their error had offended 
                        <lb n="30511"/>deeply God's majesty, though it was the error of two children, 
                        <lb n="30512"/>but it had not offended her whose beauty <emph>is not like earthly</emph> 
                        <lb n="30513"/><emph>beauty, dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star</emph> 
                        <lb n="30514"/><emph>which is its emblem, bright and musical</emph>. The eyes were not 
                        <lb n="30515"/>offended which she turned upon them nor reproachful. She 
                        <lb n="30516"/>placed their hands together, hand in hand, and said, speaking 
                        <lb n="30517"/>to their hearts: 
                        <lb n="30518"/><said who="Virgin Mary">―Take hands, Stephen and Emma. It is a beautiful evening 
                            <lb n="30519"/>now in heaven. You have erred but you are always my children. 
                            <lb n="30520"/>It is one heart that loves another heart. Take hands together, 
                            <lb n="30521"/>my dear children, and you  will  be happy together and your 
                            <lb n="30522"/>hearts will love each other.</said> </p>

                        <lb n="30524"/>through the lowered blinds: and through the fissure between 
                        <lb n="30525"/>the last blind and the sash a shaft of wan light entered like a

                            <lb n="30550"/>Lucifer and his rebellious angels might be filled again. Lucifer, 
                            <lb n="30551"/>we are  told, was a son of the morning, a radiant and mighty

                            <lb n="30563"/>The fruitful earth gave them her bounty: beasts and birds were

                            <lb n="30623"/>ment of sinners. Hell is a strait and dark and foulsmelling 
                            <lb n="30624"/>prison, an abode of demons and lost souls, filled with fire and 
                            <lb n="30625"/>smoke. The straitness of this prison house is expressly designed 
                            <lb n="30626"/>by God to punish those who refused to be bound by His laws. 
                            <lb n="30627"/>In earthly prisons the poor captive has at least some liberty of 
                            <lb n="30628"/>movement, were it only within the four walls of his cell or in 
                            <lb n="30629"/>the gloomy yard of his prison. Not so in hell. There, by reason 
                            <lb n="30630"/>of the great number of the damned, the prisoners are heaped 
                            <lb n="30631"/>together in their awful prison the walls of which are said to be 
                            <lb n="30632"/>four thousand miles thick: and the damned are so utterly 
                            <lb n="30633"/>bound and helpless that, as a blessed saint, saint Anselm, writes 
                            <lb n="30634"/>in his book on similitudes, they are not even able to remove 
                            <lb n="30635"/>from the eye a worm that gnaws it. </said>

                            <lb n="30637"/>gives forth no light. As, at the command of God, the fire of the 
                            <lb n="30638"/>Babylonian furnace lost its heat but not its light so, at the 
                            <lb n="30639"/>command of God, the fire of hell, while retaining the intensity 
                            <lb n="30640"/>of its heat, burns eternally in darkness. It is a neverending 
                            <lb n="30641"/>storm of darkness, dark flames and dark smoke of burning 
                            <lb n="30642"/>brimstone, amid which the bodies are heaped one upon another 
                            <lb n="30643"/>without even a glimpse of air. Of all the plagues with which the 
                            <lb n="30644"/>land of the Pharaohs was smitten one plague alone, that of 
                            <lb n="30645"/>darkness, was called horrible. What name, then, shall we give 
                            <lb n="30646"/>to the darkness of hell which is to last not for three days alone

                            <lb n="30649"/>awful stench. All the filth of the world, all the offal and scum 
                            <lb n="30650"/>of the world, we are told, shall run there as to a vast reeking 
                            <lb n="30651"/>sewer when the terrible conflagration of the last day has purged 
                            <lb n="30652"/>the world. The brimstone too which burns there in such pro- 
                            <lb n="30653"/>digious quantity fills all hell with its intolerable stench: and the 
                            <lb n="30654"/>bodies of the damned themselves exhale such a pestilential 
                            <lb n="30655"/>odour that, as saint Bonaventure says, one of them alone would 
                            <lb n="30656"/>suffice to infect the whole world. The very air of this world, 
                            <lb n="30657"/>that pure element, becomes foul and unbreathable when it has 
                            <lb n="30658"/>been long enclosed. Consider then what must be the foulness of 
                            <lb n="30659"/>the air of hell. Imagine some foul and putrid corpse that has 
                            <lb n="30660"/>lain rotting and decomposing in the grave, a jellylike mass of 
                            <lb n="30661"/>liquid corruption. Imagine such a corpse a prey to  flames, 
                            <lb n="30662"/>devoured by the fire of burning brimstone and giving off dense 
                            <lb n="30663"/>choking fumes of nauseous loathsome decomposition. And 
                            <lb n="30664"/>then imagine this sickening stench, multiplied a millionfold and 
                            <lb n="30665"/>a millionfold again from the millions upon millions of fetid 
                            <lb n="30666"/>carcases massed together in the reeking darkness,  a huge and 
                            <lb n="30667"/>rotting human fungus. Imagine all this and you will have some 
                            <lb n="30668"/>idea of the horror of the stench of hell. </said>

                            <lb n="30670"/>physical torment to which the damned are subjected. The 
                            <lb n="30671"/>torment of fire is the greatest torment to which the tyrant has 
                            <lb n="30672"/>ever subjected his fellowcreatures. Place your finger for a mo- 
                            <lb n="30673"/>ment in the flame of a candle and you will feel the pain of fire. 
                            <lb n="30674"/>But our earthly fire was created by God for the benefit of man, 
                            <lb n="30675"/>to maintain in him the spark of life and to help him in the 
                            <lb n="30676"/>useful arts whereas the fire of hell is of another quality and was 
                            <lb n="30677"/>created by God to torture and punish the unrepentant sinner.

                            <lb n="30680"/>that human ingenuity has even succeeded in inventing chemical 
                            <lb n="30681"/>preparations to check or frustrate its action. But the sulphu- 
                            <lb n="30682"/>reous brimstone which burns in hell is a substance which is 
                            <lb n="30683"/>specially designed to burn for ever and for ever with unspeak- 
                            <lb n="30684"/>able fury. Moreover our earthly fire destroys at the same time 
                            <lb n="30685"/>as it burns so that the more intense it is the shorter is its dur- 
                            <lb n="30686"/>ation: but the fire of hell has this property that it preserves that 
                            <lb n="30687"/>which it burns and though it rages with incredible intensity it 
                            <lb n="30688"/>rages for ever. </said>

                            <lb n="30690"/>may be, is always of a limited extent: but the lake of fire in hell 
                            <lb n="30691"/>is boundless, shoreless and bottomless. It is on record that the 
                            <lb n="30692"/>devil himself, when asked the question by a certain soldier, was 
                            <lb n="30693"/>obliged to confess that if a whole mountain were thrown into 
                            <lb n="30694"/>the burning ocean of hell it would be burned up in an instant 
                            <lb n="30695"/>like a piece of wax. And this terrible fire will not afflict the

                            <lb n="30697"/>be a hell unto itself, the boundless fire raging in its very vitals. 
                            <lb n="30698"/>O, how terrible is the lot of those wretched beings! The blood

                            <lb n="30704"/>boundlessness of this fire is as nothing when compared to its 
                            <lb n="30705"/>intensity, an intensity which it has as being the instrument 
                            <lb n="30706"/>chosen by divine design for the punishment of soul and body 
                            <lb n="30707"/>alike. It is a fire which proceeds directly from the ire of God, 
                            <lb n="30708"/>working not of its own activity but as an instrument of divine 
                            <lb n="30709"/>vengeance. As the waters of baptism cleanse the soul with the 
                            <lb n="30710"/>body so do the fires of punishment torture the spirit with the 
                            <lb n="30711"/>flesh. Every sense of the flesh is tortured and every faculty of 
                            <lb n="30712"/>the soul therewith: the eyes with impenetrable utter darkness, 
                            <lb n="30713"/>the nose with noisome odours, the ears with yells and howls

                            <lb n="30718"/>its very essence amid the leagues upon leagues of glowing fires

                            <lb n="30723"/>increased by the company of the damned themselves. Evil com- 
                            <lb n="30724"/>pany on earth is so noxious that even the plants, as if by 
                            <lb n="30725"/>instinct, withdraw from the company of whatsoever is deadly 
                            <lb n="30726"/>or hurtful to them. In hell all laws are overturned: there is no 
                            <lb n="30727"/>thought of family or country, of ties or relationship. The 
                            <lb n="30728"/>damned howl and scream at one another, their torture and rage 
                            <lb n="30729"/>intensified by the presence of beings tortured and raging like 
                            <lb n="30730"/>themselves. All sense of humanity is forgotten. The yells of the 
                            <lb n="30731"/>suffering sinners fill the remotest corners of the vast abyss. The 
                            <lb n="30732"/>mouths of the damned are full of blasphemies against God and 
                            <lb n="30733"/>of hatred for their fellow sufferers and of curses against those 
                            <lb n="30734"/>souls which were their  accomplices in sin. In olden times it was 
                            <lb n="30735"/>the custom to punish the parricide, the man who had raised his 
                            <lb n="30736"/>murderous hand against his father, by casting him into the 
                            <lb n="30737"/>depths of the sea in a sack in which were placed a cock, a 
                            <lb n="30738"/>monkey and a serpent. The intention of those lawgivers who 
                            <lb n="30739"/>framed such a law, which seems cruel in our times, was to 
                            <lb n="30740"/>punish the criminal by the company of hateful and hurtful 
                            <lb n="30741"/>beasts. But what is the fury of those dumb beasts compared 
                            <lb n="30742"/>with the fury of execration which bursts from the parched lips 
                            <lb n="30743"/>and aching throats of the damned in hell when they behold in 
                            <lb n="30744"/>their companions in misery those who aided and abetted them 
                            <lb n="30745"/>in sin, those whose words sowed the first seeds of evil thinking 
                            <lb n="30746"/>and evil living in their minds, those whose immodest sugges- 
                            <lb n="30747"/>tions led them on to sin, those whose eyes tempted and allured 
                            <lb n="30748"/>them from the path of virtue. They turn upon those accom- 
                            <lb n="30749"/>plices and upbraid them and curse them. But they are helpless 
                            <lb n="30750"/>and hopeless: it is too late now for repentance. </said>

                            <lb n="30755"/>horrible these devils are. Saint Catherine of Siena once saw a

                            <lb n="30758"/>walk until the end of her life along a track of red coals. These 
                            <lb n="30759"/>devils, who were once beautiful angels, have become as hideous 
                            <lb n="30760"/>and ugly as they once were beautiful. They mock and  jeer at 
                            <lb n="30761"/>the lost souls whom they dragged down to ruin. It is they, the 
                            <lb n="30762"/>foul demons, who are made in hell the voices of conscience. 
                            <lb n="30763"/>Why did you sin? Why did you lend an ear to the temptings of

                            <lb n="30766"/>did you not leave that evil companion? Why did you not give 
                            <lb n="30767"/>up that lewd habit, that impure habit? Why did you not listen 
                            <lb n="30768"/>to the counsels of your confessor? Why did you not, even after

                            <lb n="30770"/>or the hundredth time, repent of your evil ways and turn to 
                            <lb n="30771"/>God who only waited for your repentance to absolve you of 
                            <lb n="30772"/>your sins? Now the time for repentance has gone by. Time is,

                            <lb n="30774"/>to indulge in that sloth and pride, to covet the unlawful, to 
                            <lb n="30775"/>yield to the promptings of your lower nature, to live like the 
                            <lb n="30776"/>beasts of the field, nay worse than the beasts of the field for 
                            <lb n="30777"/>they, at least, are but brutes and have not reason to guide them: 
                            <lb n="30778"/>time was but time shall be no more. God spoke to you by so 
                            <lb n="30779"/>many voices but you would not hear. You would not crush out 
                            <lb n="30780"/>that pride and anger in your heart, you would not restore those 
                            <lb n="30781"/>illgotten goods, you would not obey the precepts of your holy 
                            <lb n="30782"/>church nor attend to your religious duties, you would not 
                            <lb n="30783"/>abandon those wicked companions, you would not avoid those 
                            <lb n="30784"/>dangerous temptations. Such is the language of those fiendish 
                            <lb n="30785"/>tormentors, words of taunting and of reproach, of hatred and 
                            <lb n="30786"/>of disgust. Of disgust, yes! For even they, the very devils, when 
                            <lb n="30787"/>they sinned sinned by such a sin as alone was compatible with 
                            <lb n="30788"/>such angelical natures, a rebellion of the intellect: and they, 
                            <lb n="30789"/>even they, the foul devils must turn away, revolted and dis- 
                            <lb n="30790"/>gusted, from the contemplation of those unspeakable sins by 
                            <lb n="30791"/>which degraded man outrages and defiles the temple of the 
                            <lb n="30792"/>Holy Ghost, defiles and pollutes himself. </said>
                        <lb n="30793"/><said who="Father Arnall">―O, my dear little brothers in Christ, may it never be our lot 
                            <lb n="30794"/>to hear that language! May it never be our lot, I say! In the last 
                            <lb n="30795"/>day of terrible reckoning I pray fervently to God that not a

                            <lb n="30797"/>among those miserable beings whom the Great Judge shall 
                            <lb n="30798"/>command to depart for ever from His sight, that not one of us

                    <lb n="30802"/><p> He came down the aisle of the chapel, his legs shaking and 
                        <lb n="30803"/>the scalp of his head trembling as though it had been touched 
                        <lb n="30804"/>by ghostly fingers. He passed up the staircase and into the 
                        <lb n="30805"/>corridor along the walls of which the overcoats and water- 
                        <lb n="30806"/>proofs hung like gibbeted malefactors, headless and dripping 
                        <lb n="30807"/>and shapeless. And at every step he feared that he had already 
                        <lb n="30808"/>died, that his soul had been wrenched forth of the sheath of his 
                        <lb n="30809"/>body, that he was plunging headlong through space. </p>
                    <lb n="30810"/><p> He could not grip the floor with his feet and sat heavily at 
                        <lb n="30811"/>his desk, opening one of his books at random and poring over 
                        <lb n="30812"/>it. Every word for him! It was true. God was almighty. God 
                        <lb n="30813"/>could call him now, call him as he sat at his desk, before he had 
                        <lb n="30814"/>time to be conscious of the summons. God had called him. Yes? 
                        <lb n="30815"/>What? Yes? His flesh shrank together as it felt the approach of 
                        <lb n="30816"/>the ravenous tongues of flames, dried up as it felt about it the 
                        <lb n="30817"/>swirl of stifling air. He had died. Yes. He was judged. A wave 
                        <lb n="30818"/>of fire swept through his body: the first. Again a wave. His 
                        <lb n="30819"/>brain began to glow. Another. His brain was simmering and 
                        <lb n="30820"/>bubbling within the cracking tenement of the skull. Flames 
                        <lb n="30821"/>burst forth from his skull like a corolla, shrieking like voices:

                    <lb n="30823"/><p> Voices spoke near him:

                        <lb n="30830"/>had spared him still. He was still in the familiar world of the 
                        <lb n="30831"/>school. Mr Tate and Vincent Heron stood at the window, 
                        <lb n="30832"/>talking, jesting, gazing out at the bleak rain, moving their }|lb n="30833"/| heads.

                    <lb n="30838"/><p>The voices that he knew so well, the common words, the 
                        <lb n="30839"/>quiet of the classroom when the voices paused and the silence 
                        <lb n="30840"/>was filled by the sound of softly browsing cattle as the other 
                        <lb n="30841"/>boys munched their lunches tranquilly, lulled his aching soul. </p>
                    <lb n="30842"/><p> There was still time. O Mary, refuge of sinners, intercede for

                    <lb n="30844"/><p> The English lesson began with the hearing of the history. 
                        <lb n="30845"/>Royal persons, favourites, intriguers, bishops passed like mute 
                        <lb n="30846"/>phantoms behind their veil of names. All had died: all had been 
                        <lb n="30847"/>judged. What did it profit a man to gain the whole world if he 
                        <lb n="30848"/>lost his soul? At last he had understood: and human life lay 
                        <lb n="30849"/>around him, a plain of peace whereon antlike men laboured in 
                        <lb n="30850"/>brotherhood, their dead sleeping under quiet mounds. The el- 
                        <lb n="30851"/>bow of his companion touched him and his heart was touched: 
                        <lb n="30852"/>and when he spoke to answer a question of his master he heard 
                        <lb n="30853"/>his own voice full of the quietude of humility and contrition. </p>
                    <lb n="30854"/><p> His soul sank back deeper into depths of contrite peace, no 
                        <lb n="30855"/>longer able to suffer the pain of dread and sending forth, as she 
                        <lb n="30856"/>sank, a faint prayer. Ah yes, he would still be spared; he would 
                        <lb n="30857"/>repent in his heart and be forgiven: and then those above, those 
                        <lb n="30858"/>in heaven, would see what he would do to make up for the 
                        <lb n="30859"/>past: a whole life, every hour of life. Only wait. 
                        <lb n="30860"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―All, God! All, all!</said> </p>
                    <lb n="30861"/><p> A messenger came to the door to say that confessions were 
                        <lb n="30862"/>being heard in the chapel. Four boys left the room; and he 
                        <lb n="30863"/>heard others passing down the corridor. A tremulous chill blew 
                        <lb n="30864"/>round his heart, no stronger than a little wind, and yet, listen- 
                        <lb n="30865"/>ing and suffering silently, he seemed to have laid an ear against 
                        <lb n="30866"/>the muscle of his own heart, feeling it close and quail, listening 
                        <lb n="30867"/>to the flutter of its ventricles. </p>
                    <lb n="30868"/><p> No escape. He had to confess, to speak out in words what he 
                        <lb n="30869"/>had done and thought, sin after sin. How? How? 
                        <lb n="30870"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Father, I ...</said> </p>
                    <lb n="30871"/><p>The thought slid like a cold shining rapier into his tender 
                        <lb n="30872"/>flesh: confession. But not there in the chapel of the college. He 
                        <lb n="30873"/>would confess all, every sin of deed and thought, sincerely: but 
                        <lb n="30874"/>not there among his school companions. Far away from there 
                        <lb n="30875"/>in some dark place he would murmur out his own shame: and 
                        <lb n="30876"/>he besought God humbly not to be offended with him if he did 
                        <lb n="30877"/>not dare to confess in the college chapel: and in utter abjection 
                        <lb n="30878"/>of spirit he craved forgiveness mutely of the boyish hearts 
                        <lb n="30879"/>about him. </p>
                    <lb n="30880"/><p> Time passed. </p>
                    <lb n="30881"/><p> He sat again in the front bench of the chapel. The daylight 
                        <lb n="30882"/>without was already failing and, as it fell slowly through the 
                        <lb n="30883"/>dull red blinds, it seemed that the sun of the last day was going 
                        <lb n="30884"/>down and that all souls were being gathered for the judgment. 
                        <lb n="30885"/><said who="Father Arnall">―<emph>I am cast away from the sight of Thine eyes:</emph> words taken, 
                            <lb n="30886"/>my dear little brothers in Christ, from the Book of Psalms,

                    <lb n="30889"/><p> The preacher began to speak in a quiet friendly tone. His 
                        <lb n="30890"/>face was kind and he joined gently the fingers of each hand, 
                        <lb n="30891"/>forming a frail cage by the union of their tips. 
                        <lb n="30892"/><said who="Father Arnall">―This morning we endeavoured, in our reflection upon hell, 
                            <lb n="30893"/>to make what our holy founder calls in his book of spiritual 
                            <lb n="30894"/>exercises, the composition of place. We endeavoured, that is, to 
                            <lb n="30895"/>imagine with the senses of the mind, in our imagination, the 
                            <lb n="30896"/>material character of that awful place and of the physical tor- 
                            <lb n="30897"/>ments which all who are in hell endure. This evening we shall 
                            <lb n="30898"/>consider for a few moments the nature of the spiritual torments 
                            <lb n="30899"/>of hell. </said>
                        <lb n="30900"/><said who="Father Arnall">―Sin, remember, is a twofold enormity. It is a base consent to 
                            <lb n="30901"/>the promptings of our corrupt nature, to the lower instincts, to 
                            <lb n="30902"/>that which is gross and beastlike; and it is also a turning away 
                            <lb n="30903"/>from the counsel of our higher nature, from all that is pure and 
                            <lb n="30904"/>holy, from the Holy God Himself. For this reason mortal sin is 
                            <lb n="30905"/>punished in hell by two different forms of punishment, physical 
                            <lb n="30906"/>and spiritual. </said>
                        <lb n="30907"/><said who="Father Arnall">―Now of all these spiritual pains by far the greatest is the pain 
                            <lb n="30908"/>of loss, so great, in fact, that in itself it is a torment greater 
                            <lb n="30909"/>than all the others. Saint Thomas, the greatest doctor of the 
                            <lb n="30910"/>church, the angelic doctor, as he is called, says that the worst 
                            <lb n="30911"/>damnation consists in this that the understanding of man is 
                            <lb n="30912"/>totally deprived of divine light and his affection obstinately 
                            <lb n="30913"/>turned away from the goodness of God. God, remember, is a 
                            <lb n="30914"/>being infinitely good and therefore the loss of such a being 
                            <lb n="30915"/>must be a loss infinitely painful. In this life we have not a very 
                            <lb n="30916"/>clear idea of what such a loss must be but the damned in hell, 
                            <lb n="30917"/>for their greater torment, have a full understanding of that 
                            <lb n="30918"/>which they have lost and understand  that they have lost it 
                            <lb n="30919"/>through their own sins and have lost it for ever. At the very 
                            <lb n="30920"/>instant of death the bonds of the flesh are broken asunder and 
                            <lb n="30921"/>the soul at once flies towards God. The soul tends towards 
                            <lb n="30922"/>God as towards the centre of her existence. Remember, my 
                            <lb n="30923"/>dear little boys, our souls long to be with God. We come from 
                            <lb n="30924"/>God, we live by God, we belong to God: we are His, inalien- 
                            <lb n="30925"/>ably His. God loves with a divine love every human soul and 
                            <lb n="30926"/>every human soul lives in that love. How could it be otherwise? 
                            <lb n="30927"/>Every breath that we draw, every thought of our brain, every

                            <lb n="30941"/>hell is the pain of conscience. Just as in dead bodies worms are 
                            <lb n="30942"/>engendered by putrefaction so in the souls of the lost there 
                            <lb n="30943"/>arises a perpetual remorse from the putrefaction of sin, the 
                            <lb n="30944"/>sting of conscience, the worm, as Pope Innocent the Third calls 
                            <lb n="30945"/>it, of the triple sting. The first sting inflicted by this cruel worm 
                            <lb n="30946"/>will be the memory of past pleasures. O what a dreadful mem-

                            <lb n="30952"/>feasts, his dishes prepared with such delicacy, his choice wines; 
                            <lb n="30953"/>the miser will remember his hoard of gold, the robber his 
                            <lb n="30954"/>illgotten wealth, the angry and revengeful and merciless mur-

                            <lb n="30959"/>pleasures seem to the soul condemned to suffer in hellfire for 
                            <lb n="30960"/>ages and ages. How they will rage and fume to think that they

                            <lb n="30962"/>pieces of metal, for vain honours, for bodily comforts, for a 
                            <lb n="30963"/>tingling of the nerves. They will repent indeed: and this is the 
                            <lb n="30964"/>second sting of the worm of conscience, a late and fruitless 
                            <lb n="30965"/>sorrow for sins committed. Divine justice insists that the under-

                            <lb n="30969"/>knowledge of sin so that sin will appear to them in all its 
                            <lb n="30970"/>hideous malice as it appears to the eyes of God Himself. They 
                            <lb n="30971"/>will behold their sins in all their foulness and repent but it will 
                            <lb n="30972"/>be too late and then they will bewail the good occasions which 
                            <lb n="30973"/>they neglected. This is the last and deepest and most cruel sting 
                            <lb n="30974"/>of the worm of conscience. The conscience will say: You had 
                            <lb n="30975"/>time and opportunity to repent and would not. You were 
                            <lb n="30976"/>brought up religiously by your parents. You had the sacraments 
                            <lb n="30977"/>and graces and indulgences of the church to aid you. You had 
                            <lb n="30978"/>the minister of God to preach to you, to call you back when 
                            <lb n="30979"/>you had strayed, to forgive you your sins, no matter how many, 
                            <lb n="30980"/>how abominable, if only you had confessed and repented. No. 
                            <lb n="30981"/>You would not. You flouted the ministers of holy religion, you 
                            <lb n="30982"/>turned your back on the confessional, you wallowed deeper 
                            <lb n="30983"/>and deeper in the mire of sin. God appealed to you, threatened 
                            <lb n="30984"/>you, entreated you to return to Him. O what shame, what 
                            <lb n="30985"/>misery! The ruler of the universe entreated you, a creature 
                            <lb n="30986"/>of clay, to love Him Who  made you and to keep His law. 
                            <lb n="30987"/>No. You would not. And now, though you were to flood all 
                            <lb n="30988"/>hell with your tears if you could still weep, all that sea of 
                            <lb n="30989"/>repentance would not gain for you what a single tear of true 
                            <lb n="30990"/>repentance shed during your mortal life would have gained for 
                            <lb n="30991"/>you. You implore now a moment of earthly life wherein to 
                            <lb n="30992"/>repent: in vain. That time is gone: gone for ever. </said>

                            <lb n="31002"/>the pain of extension. Man, in this earthly life, though he be 
                            <lb n="31003"/>capable of many evils, is not capable of them all at once inas- 
                            <lb n="31004"/>much as one evil corrects and counteracts  another just as one 
                            <lb n="31005"/>poison frequently corrects another. In hell on the contrary one 
                            <lb n="31006"/>torment, instead of counteracting another, lends it still greater 
                            <lb n="31007"/>force: and moreover as the internal faculties are more perfect 
                            <lb n="31008"/>than the external senses so are they more capable of suffering. 
                            <lb n="31009"/>Just as every sense is afflicted with a fitting torment so is every

                            <lb n="31015"/>souls is an evil of boundless extension, of limitless duration, a 
                            <lb n="31016"/>frightful state of wickedness which we can scarcely realise

                            <lb n="31034"/>they are of terrible intensity they are at the same time of con-

                            <lb n="31058"/>imagine the awful meaning of this. You have often seen the 
                            <lb n="31059"/>sand on the seashore. How fine are its tiny grains! And how 
                            <lb n="31060"/>many of those tiny little grains go to make up the small handful

                            <lb n="31062"/>that sand, a million miles high, reaching from the earth to the 
                            <lb n="31063"/>farthest heavens, and a million miles broad, extending to re-

                            <lb n="31066"/>plied as often as there are leaves in the forest, drops of water in

                            <lb n="31068"/>animals, atoms in the vast expanse of the air: and imagine that 
                            <lb n="31069"/>at the end of every million years a little bird came to that 
                            <lb n="31070"/>mountain and carried away in its beak a tiny grain of that sand.

                        <lb n="31231"/>To be alone with his soul, to examine his conscience, to meet 
                        <lb n="31232"/>his sins face to face, to recall their times and manners and 
                        <lb n="31233"/>circumstances, to weep over them. He could not weep. He 
                        <lb n="31234"/>could not summon them to his memory. He felt only an ache of 
                        <lb n="31235"/>soul and body, his whole being, memory, will, understanding, 
                        <lb n="31236"/>flesh, benumbed and weary. </p>
                    <lb n="31237"/><p> That was the work of devils, to scatter his thoughts and 
                        <lb n="31238"/>overcloud his conscience, assailing him at the gates of the cow- 
                        <lb n="31239"/>ardly and sincorrupted flesh: and, praying God timidly to 
                        <lb n="31240"/>forgive him his weakness, he crawled up on to the bed and, 
                        <lb n="31241"/>wrapping the blankets closely about him, covered his face again 
                        <lb n="31242"/>with his hands. He had  sinned. He had sinned so deeply against 
                        <lb n="31243"/>heaven and before God that he was not worthy to be called 
                        <lb n="31244"/>God's child. </p>
                    <lb n="31245"/><p> Could it be that he, Stephen Dedalus, had done those things? 
                        <lb n="31246"/>His conscience sighed in answer. Yes, he had done them, se- 
                        <lb n="31247"/>cretly, filthily, time after time, and, hardened in sinful impeni- 
                        <lb n="31248"/>tence, he had dared to wear the mask of holiness before the 
                        <lb n="31249"/>tabernacle itself while his soul within was a living mass of 
                        <lb n="31250"/>corruption. How came it that God had not struck him dead? 
                        <lb n="31251"/>The leprous company of his sins closed about him, breathing 
                        <lb n="31252"/>upon him, bending over him from all sides. He strove to forget 
                        <lb n="31253"/>them in an act of prayer, huddling his limbs closer  together and 
                        <lb n="31254"/>binding down his eyelids: but the senses of the soul would not 
                        <lb n="31255"/>be bound and, though his eyes were shut fast, he saw the places 
                        <lb n="31256"/>where he had sinned and, though his ears were tightly covered, 
                        <lb n="31257"/>he heard. He desired with all his will not to hear or see. He 
                        <lb n="31258"/>desired till his frame shook under the strain of his desire and 
                        <lb n="31259"/>until the senses of his soul closed. They closed for an instant 
                        <lb n="31260"/>and then opened. He saw. </p>
                    <lb n="31261"/><p> A field of stiff weeds and thistles and tufted nettlebunches. 
                        <lb n="31262"/>Thick among the tufts of rank stiff growth lay battered canis- 
                        <lb n="31263"/>ters and clots and coils of solid excrement. A faint marshlight 
                        <lb n="31264"/>struggled upwards from all the ordure through the bristling 
                        <lb n="31265"/>greygreen weeds. An evil smell, faint and foul as the light, 
                        <lb n="31266"/>curled upwards sluggishly out of the canisters and from the 
                        <lb n="31267"/>stale crusted dung. </p>
                    <lb n="31268"/><p> Creatures were in the field; one, three, six: creatures were 
                        <lb n="31269"/>moving in the field, hither and thither. Goatish creatures with 
                        <lb n="31270"/>human faces, hornybrowed, lightly bearded and grey as india- 
                        <lb n="31271"/>rubber. The malice of evil glittered in their hard eyes, as they 
                        <lb n="31272"/>moved hither and thither, trailing their long tails behind them. 
                        <lb n="31273"/>A rictus of cruel malignity lit up greyly their old bony faces. 
                        <lb n="31274"/>One was clasping about his ribs a torn flannel waistcoat, an- 
                        <lb n="31275"/>other complained monotonously as his beard stuck in the 
                        <lb n="31276"/>tufted weeds. Soft language issued from their spittleless lips as 
                        <lb n="31277"/>they swished in slow circles round and round the field, winding 
                        <lb n="31278"/>hither and thither through the weeds, dragging their long tails 
                        <lb n="31279"/>amid the rattling canisters. They moved in slow circles, circling 
                        <lb n="31280"/>closer and closer, to enclose, to  enclose, soft language issuing 
                        <lb n="31281"/>from their lips, their long swishing tails  besmeared with stale 
                        <lb n="31282"/>shite, thrusting upwards their terrific faces ..... </p>
                    <lb n="31283"/><p> Help! </p>
                    <lb n="31284"/><p> He flung the blankets from him madly to free his face and 
                        <lb n="31285"/>neck. That was his hell. God had allowed him to see the hell 
                        <lb n="31286"/>reserved for his sins: stinking, bestial, malignant, a hell of lech- 
                        <lb n="31287"/>erous goatish fiends. For him! For him! </p>
                    <lb n="31288"/><p> He sprang from the bed, the reeking odour pouring down 
                        <lb n="31289"/>his throat, clogging and revolting his entrails. Air! The air of 
                        <lb n="31290"/>heaven! He stumbled towards the window, groaning and al- 
                        <lb n="31291"/>most fainting with sickness. At the washstand a convulsion 
                        <lb n="31292"/>seized him within: and, clasping his cold forehead wildly, he 
                        <lb n="31293"/>vomited profusely in agony. </p>
                    <lb n="31294"/><p> When the fit had spent itself he walked weakly to the win- 
                        <lb n="31295"/>dow and, lifting the sash, sat in a corner of the embrasure and 
                        <lb n="31296"/>leaned his elbow upon the sill. The rain had drawn off; and 
                        <lb n="31297"/>amid the moving vapours from point to point of light the city 
                        <lb n="31298"/>was spinning about herself a soft cocoon of yellowish haze. 
                        <lb n="31299"/>Heaven was still and faintly luminous and the air sweet to 
                        <lb n="31300"/>breathe, as in a thicket drenched with showers: and amid peace 
                        <lb n="31301"/>and shimmering lights and quiet fragrances he made a covenant 
                        <lb n="31302"/>with his heart. </p>
                    <lb n="31303"/><p> He prayed:

                                <lb n="31305"/>we sinned: and then He could not safely visit us but with a 
                                <lb n="31306"/>shrouded majesty and a bedimmed radiance for He was God. 
                                <lb n="31307"/>So He came Himself in weakness not in power and He sent 
                                <lb n="31308"/>thee, a creature in His stead, with a creature's comeliness and 
                                <lb n="31309"/>lustre suited to our state. And now thy very face and form, dear 
                                <lb n="31310"/>mother, speak to us of the Eternal; not like earthly beauty, 
                                <lb n="31311"/>dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star which is thy 
                                <lb n="31312"/>emblem, bright and musical, breathing purity, telling of heaven 
                                <lb n="31313"/>and infusing peace. O harbinger of day! O light of the pilgrim! 
                                <lb n="31314"/>Lead us still as thou hast led. In the dark night, across the bleak

                    <lb n="31316"/><p>His eyes were dimmed with tears and, looking humbly up to 
                        <lb n="31317"/>heaven, he wept for the innocence he had lost. </p>
                    <lb n="31318"/><p> When evening had fallen he left the house and the first touch 
                        <lb n="31319"/>of the damp dark air and the noise of the door as it closed 
                        <lb n="31320"/>behind him made ache again his conscience, lulled by prayer 
                        <lb n="31321"/>and tears. Confess! Confess! It was not enough to lull the con- 
                        <lb n="31322"/>science with a tear and a prayer. He had to kneel before the 
                        <lb n="31323"/>minister of the Holy Ghost and tell over his hidden sins truly 
                        <lb n="31324"/>and repentantly. Before he heard again the footboard of the 
                        <lb n="31325"/>housedoor trail over the threshold  as it opened to let him in, 
                        <lb n="31326"/>before he saw again the table in the kitchen set for supper he 
                        <lb n="31327"/>would have knelt and confessed. It was quite simple. </p>
                    <lb n="31328"/><p> The ache of conscience ceased and he walked onward swiftly 
                        <lb n="31329"/>through the dark streets. There were so many flagstones on the 
                        <lb n="31330"/>footpath of that street and so many streets in that city and so 
                        <lb n="31331"/>many cities in the world. Yet eternity had no end. He was in 
                        <lb n="31332"/>mortal sin. Even once was a mortal sin. It could happen in an 
                        <lb n="31333"/>instant. But how so quickly? By seeing or by thinking of seeing. 
                        <lb n="31334"/>The eyes see the thing, without having wished first to see. Then 
                        <lb n="31335"/>in an instant it happens. But does that part of the body under- 
                        <lb n="31336"/>stand or what? The serpent, the most subtle beast of the field. 
                        <lb n="31337"/>It must understand when it desires in one instant and then 
                        <lb n="31338"/>prolongs its own desire instant after instant, sinfully. It feels 
                        <lb n="31339"/>and understands and desires. What a horrible thing! Who made 
                        <lb n="31340"/>it to be like that, a bestial part of the body able to understand 
                        <lb n="31341"/>bestially and desire bestially? Was that then he or an inhuman 
                        <lb n="31342"/>thing moved by a lower soul than his soul? His soul sickened at 
                        <lb n="31343"/>the thought of a torpid snaky life feeding itself out of the tender 
                        <lb n="31344"/>marrow of his life and fattening upon the slime of lust. O why 
                        <lb n="31345"/>was that so? O why? </p>
                    <lb n="31346"/><p> He cowered in the shadow of the thought, abasing himself in 
                        <lb n="31347"/>the awe of God  Who had made all things and all men. Mad- 
                        <lb n="31348"/>ness. Who could think such a thought? And, cowering in 
                        <lb n="31349"/>darkness and abject, he prayed mutely to his angel guardian to 
                        <lb n="31350"/>drive away with his sword the demon that was whispering to 
                        <lb n="31351"/>his brain. </p>
                    <lb n="31352"/><p> The whisper ceased and he knew then clearly that his own 
                        <lb n="31353"/>soul had sinned in thought and word and deed wilfully through 
                        <lb n="31354"/>his own body. Confess! He had to confess every sin. How could 
                        <lb n="31355"/>he utter in words to the priest what he had done? Must, must. 
                        <lb n="31356"/>Or how could he explain without dying of shame? Or how 
                        <lb n="31357"/>could he have done such things without shame? A madman, a 
                        <lb n="31358"/>loathsome madman! Confess! O he would indeed to be free and 
                        <lb n="31359"/>sinless again! Perhaps the priest would know. O dear God! </p>
                    <lb n="31360"/><p> He walked on and on through illlit  streets, fearing to stand 
                        <lb n="31361"/>still for a moment lest it might seem that he held back from 
                        <lb n="31362"/>what awaited him, fearing to arrive at that towards which he 
                        <lb n="31363"/>still turned with longing. How beautiful must be a soul in the 
                        <lb n="31364"/>state of grace when God looked upon it with love! </p>
                    <lb n="31365"/><p> Frowsy girls sat along the curbstones before their baskets. 
                        <lb n="31366"/>Their dank hair hung trailed  over their brows. They were not 
                        <lb n="31367"/>beautiful to see as they crouched in the mire. But their souls 
                        <lb n="31368"/>were seen by God; and if their souls were in a state of grace 
                        <lb n="31369"/>they were radiant to see: and God loved them, seeing them. </p>
                    <lb n="31370"/><p> A wasting breath of humiliation blew bleakly over his soul 
                        <lb n="31371"/>to think of how he had fallen, to feel that those souls were 
                        <lb n="31372"/>dearer to God than his. The wind blew over him and passed on 
                        <lb n="31373"/>to the myriads and myriads of other souls on whom God's 
                        <lb n="31374"/>favour shone now  more and now less, stars now brighter and 
                        <lb n="31375"/>now dimmer, sustained  and failing. And the glimmering souls 
                        <lb n="31376"/>passed away, sustained and failing, merged in a moving breath. 
                        <lb n="31377"/>One soul was lost; a tiny soul: his. It flickered once and went 
                        <lb n="31378"/>out, forgotten, lost. The end: black cold void waste. </p>
                    <lb n="31379"/><p> Consciousness of place came ebbing back to him slowly over 
                        <lb n="31380"/>a vast tract of time unlit, unfelt, unlived. The squalid scene 
                        <lb n="31381"/>composed itself around him; the common accents, the burning 
                        <lb n="31382"/>gasjets in the shops, odours of fish and spirits and wet sawdust, 
                        <lb n="31383"/>moving men and women. An old woman was about to cross 
                        <lb n="31384"/>the street, an oilcan in her hand. He bent down and asked her 
                        <lb n="31385"/>was there a chapel near. 
                        <lb n="30386"/><said who="an old woman">―A chapel, sir? Yes, sir. Church Street chapel. </said>

                    <lb n="31388"/><p> She shifted the can to her other hand and directed him: and, 
                        <lb n="31389"/>as she held out her reeking withered right hand under its fringe 
                        <lb n="31390"/>of shawl, he bent lower towards her, saddened and soothed by 
                        <lb n="31391"/>her voice. 
                        <lb n="31392"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Thank you. </said>
                        <lb n="31393"/><said who="an old woman">―You are quite  welcome, sir.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="31394"/><p> The candles on the high altar had been extinguished but the 
                        <lb n="31395"/>fragrance of incense still floated down the dim nave. Bearded 
                        <lb n="31396"/>workmen with pious faces were guiding a canopy out through 
                        <lb n="31397"/>a sidedoor, the sacristan aiding them with quiet gestures and 
                        <lb n="31398"/>words. A few of the faithful still lingered, praying before one of 
                        <lb n="31399"/>the sidealtars or kneeling in the benches near the confessionals. 
                        <lb n="31400"/>He approached timidly and knelt at the last bench in the body, 
                        <lb n="31401"/>thankful for the peace and silence and fragrant shadow of the 
                        <lb n="31402"/>church. The board on which he knelt was narrow and worn 
                        <lb n="31403"/>and those who knelt near him were humble followers of Jesus. 
                        <lb n="31404"/>Jesus too had been born in poverty and had worked in the shop 
                        <lb n="31405"/>of a carpenter, cutting boards and planing them, and had first 
                        <lb n="31406"/>spoken of the kingdom of God to poor fishermen, teaching all 
                        <lb n="31407"/>men to be meek and humble of heart. </p>
                    <lb n="31408"/><p> He bowed his head upon his hands, bidding his heart be 
                        <lb n="31409"/>meek and humble that he might be like those who knelt beside 
                        <lb n="31410"/>him and his prayer as acceptable as theirs. He prayed beside 
                        <lb n="31411"/>them but it was hard. His soul was foul with sin and he dared 
                        <lb n="31412"/>not ask forgiveness with the simple trust of those whom Jesus, 
                        <lb n="31413"/>in the mysterious ways of God, had called first to His side, the 
                        <lb n="31414"/>carpenters, the fishermen, poor and simple people  following a 
                        <lb n="31415"/>lowly trade, handling and shaping the wood of trees, mending 
                        <lb n="31416"/>their nets with patience. </p>
                    <lb n="31417"/><p> A tall figure came down the aisle and the penitents stirred: 
                        <lb n="31418"/>and, at the last moment glancing up swiftly, he saw a long grey 
                        <lb n="31419"/>beard and the brown habit of a capuchin. The priest entered 
                        <lb n="31420"/>the box and was hidden. Two penitents rose and entered the 
                        <lb n="31421"/>confessional at either side. The wooden slide was drawn back 
                        <lb n="31422"/>and the faint murmur of a voice troubled the silence. </p>
                    <lb n="31423"/><p> His blood began to murmur in his veins, murmuring like a 
                        <lb n="31424"/>sinful city summoned from its sleep to hear its doom. Little 
                        <lb n="31425"/>flakes of fire fell and powdery ashes fell softly, alighting on the 
                        <lb n="31426"/>houses of men. They stirred, waking from sleep, troubled by 
                        <lb n="31427"/>the heated air. </p>
                    <lb n="31428"/><p> The slide was shot back. The penitent emerged from the side 
                        <lb n="31429"/>of the box. The farther slide was drawn. A woman entered 
                        <lb n="31430"/>quietly and deftly where the first penitent had knelt. The faint 
                        <lb n="31431"/>murmur began again. </p>
                    <lb n="31432"/><p> He could still leave the chapel. He could stand up, put one 
                        <lb n="31433"/>foot before the other and walk out softly and then run, run, run 
                        <lb n="31434"/>swiftly through the dark streets. He could still escape from the 
                        <lb n="31435"/>shame. O what shame! His face was burning with shame. Had 
                        <lb n="31436"/>it been any terrible crime but that one sin! Had it been murder! 
                        <lb n="31437"/>Little fiery flakes fell and touched him at all points, shameful 
                        <lb n="31438"/>thoughts, shameful words, shameful acts. Shame covered him 
                        <lb n="31439"/>wholly like fine glowing ashes falling continually. To say it in 
                        <lb n="31440"/>words! His soul, stifling and helpless, would cease to be. </p>
                    <lb n="31441"/><p> The slide was shot back. A penitent emerged from the far- 
                        <lb n="31442"/>ther side of the box. The near slide was drawn. A penitent 
                        <lb n="31443"/>entered where the other penitent had come out. A soft whisper- 
                        <lb n="31444"/>ing noise floated in vaporous cloudlets out of the box. It was 
                        <lb n="31445"/>the woman: soft whispering cloudlets, soft whispering vapour, 
                        <lb n="31446"/>whispering and vanishing. </p>
                    <lb n="31447"/><p> He beat his breast with his fist humbly, secretly under cover 
                        <lb n="31448"/>of the wooden armrest. He would be at one with others and 
                        <lb n="31449"/>with God. He would love his neighbour. He would love God 
                        <lb n="31450"/>Who had made and loved him. He would kneel and pray with 
                        <lb n="31451"/>others and be happy. God would look down on him and on 
                        <lb n="31452"/>them and would love them all. </p>
                    <lb n="31453"/><p> It was easy to be good. God's yoke was sweet and light. It 
                        <lb n="31454"/>was better never to have sinned, to have remained always a 
                        <lb n="31455"/>child, for God loved little children and suffered them to come 
                        <lb n="31456"/>to Him. It was a terrible and a sad thing to sin. But God was 
                        <lb n="31457"/>merciful to poor sinners who were truly sorry. How true that 
                        <lb n="31458"/>was! That was indeed goodness. </p>
                    <lb n="31459"/><p> The slide was shot to suddenly. The penitent came out. He 
                        <lb n="31460"/>was next. He stood up in terror and walked blindly into the 
                        <lb n="31461"/>box. </p>
                    <lb n="31462"/><p> At last it had come. He knelt in the silent gloom and raised 
                        <lb n="31463"/>his eyes to the white crucifix suspended above him. God could 
                        <lb n="31464"/>see that he was sorry. He would tell all his sins. His confession 
                        <lb n="31465"/>would be long, long. Everybody in the chapel would know then 
                        <lb n="31466"/>what a sinner he had been. Let them know. It was true. But 
                        <lb n="31467"/>God had promised to forgive him if he was sorry. He was 
                        <lb n="31468"/>sorry. He clasped his hands and raised them towards the white 
                        <lb n="31469"/>form, praying with his darkened eyes, praying with all his 
                        <lb n="31470"/>trembling body, swaying his head to and fro like a lost crea- 
                        <lb n="31471"/>ture, praying with whimpering lips. 
                        <lb n="31472"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Sorry! Sorry! O sorry!</said> </p>
                    <lb n="31473"/><p> The slide clicked back and his heart bounded in his breast. 
                        <lb n="31474"/>The face of an old priest was at the grating, averted from him, 
                        <lb n="31475"/>leaning upon a hand. He made the sign of the cross and prayed 
                        <lb n="31476"/>of the priest to bless him for he had sinned. Then, bowing his 
                        <lb n="31477"/>head, he repeated the <seg xml:lang="la">Confiteor</seg> in fright. At the words <emph>my</emph> 
                        <lb n="31478"/><emph>most grievous fault</emph> he ceased, breathless. 
                        <lb n="31479"/><said who="Priest">―How long is it since your last confession, my child? </said>
                        <lb n="31480"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―A long time, father. </said>
                        <lb n="31481"/><said who="Priest">―A month, my child? </said>

                    <lb n="31487"/><p> He had begun. The priest asked: 
                        <lb n="31488"/><said who="Priest">―And what do you remember since that time?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="31489"/><p> He began to confess his sins: masses missed, prayers not 
                        <lb n="31490"/>said, lies. 
                        <lb n="31491"/><said who="Priest">―Anything else, my child?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="31492"/><p> Sins of anger, envy of  others, gluttony, vanity, disobedience. 
                        <lb n="31493"/><said who="Priest">―Anything else, my child? </said>
                        <lb n="31494"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Sloth. </said>
                        <lb n="31495"/><said who="Priest">―Anything else, my child?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="31496"/><p> There was no help. He murmured: 
                        <lb n="31497"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I .... committed sins of impurity, father.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="31498"/><p> The priest did not turn his head. 
                        <lb n="31499"/><said who="Priest">―With yourself, my child? </said>
                        <lb n="31500"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―And ... with others. </said>
                        <lb n="31501"/><said who="Priest">―With women, my child? </said>
                        <lb n="31502"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Yes, father. </said>
                        <lb n="31503"/><said who="Priest">Were they married women, my child?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="31504"/><p>He did not know. His sins trickled from his lips, one by one, 
                        <lb n="31505"/>trickled in shameful drops from his soul festering and oozing 
                        <lb n="31506"/>like a sore, a squalid stream of vice. The last sins oozed forth, 
                        <lb n="31507"/>sluggish, filthy. There was no more to tell. He bowed his head, 
                        <lb n="31508"/>overcome. </p>
                    <lb n="31509"/><p> The priest was silent. Then he asked: 
                        <lb n="31510"/><said who="Priest">―How old are you, my child? </said>
                        <lb n="31511"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Sixteen, father.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="31512"/>The priest passed his hand several times over his face. Then, 
                    <lb n="31513"/>resting his forehead against his hand, he leaned towards the 
                    <lb n="31514"/>grating and, with eyes still averted, spoke slowly. His voice was 
                    <lb n="31515"/>weary and old. 
                    <lb n="31516"/><said who="Priest">―You are very young, my child,</said> he said, <said who="Priest">and let me implore of 
                        <lb n="31517"/>you to give up that sin. It is a terrible sin. It kills the body and 
                        <lb n="31518"/>it kills the soul. It is the cause of many crimes and misfortunes. 
                        <lb n="31519"/>Give it up, my child, for God' sake. It is dishonourable and 
                        <lb n="31520"/>unmanly. You cannot know where that wretched habit will 
                        <lb n="31521"/>lead you or where it will come against you. As long as you 
                        <lb n="31522"/>commit that sin, my poor child, you will never be worth one 
                        <lb n="31523"/>farthing to God. Pray to our mother Mary to help you. She will 
                        <lb n="31524"/>help you, my child. Pray to Our Blessed Lady when that sin 
                        <lb n="31525"/>comes into  your mind. I am sure you will do that, will you not? 
                        <lb n="31526"/>You repent of all those sins. I am sure you do. And you will 
                        <lb n="31527"/>promise God now that by His holy grace you will never offend 
                        <lb n="31528"/>Him any more by that wicked sin. You will make that solemn 
                        <lb n="31529"/>promise to God, will you not? </said>
                    <lb n="31530"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Yes, father. </said>
                    <lb n="31531"/><p>The old and weary voice fell like sweet rain upon his quak- 
                        <lb n="31532"/>ing parching heart. How sweet and sad! 
                        <lb n="31533"/><said who="Priest">―Do so, my poor child. The devil has led you astray. Drive 
                            <lb n="31534"/>him back to hell when he tempts you to dishonour your body 
                            <lb n="31535"/>in that way - the foul spirit who hates Our Lord. Promise God 
                            <lb n="31536"/>now that you will give up that sin, that wretched wretched sin.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="31537"/><p>Blinded by his tears and by the light of God's mercifulness 
                        <lb n="31538"/>he bent his head and heard the grave words of absolution 
                        <lb n="31539"/>spoken and saw the priest's hand raised above him in token of 
                        <lb n="31540"/>forgiveness. 
                        <lb n="31541"/><said who="Priest">―God bless you, my child. Pray for me.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="31542"/><p>He knelt to say his penance, praying in a corner of the dark 
                        <lb n="31543"/>nave: and his prayers ascended to heaven from his purified 
                        <lb n="31544"/>heart like perfume streaming upwards from a heart of white 
                        <lb n="31545"/>rose. </p>
                    <lb n="31546"/><p> The  muddy streets were gay. He strode homeward, con- 
                        <lb n="31547"/>scious of an  invisible grace pervading and making light his 
                        <lb n="31548"/>limbs. In spite of all he had done it. He had confessed and God 
                        <lb n="31549"/>had pardoned him. His soul was made fair and holy once more, 
                        <lb n="31550"/>holy and happy. </p>
                    <lb n="31551"/><p> It would be beautiful to die if God so willed. It was beautiful 
                        <lb n="31552"/>to live if God so willed, to live in grace a life of peace and 
                        <lb n="31553"/>virtue and forbearance with others. </p>
                    <lb n="31554"/><p> He sat by the fire in the kitchen, not daring to speak for 
                        <lb n="31555"/>happiness. Till that moment he had not known how beautiful 
                        <lb n="31556"/>and peaceful life could be. The green square of paper pinned 
                        <lb n="31557"/>round the lamp cast down a tender shade. On the dresser was a 
                        <lb n="31558"/>plate of sausages and white pudding and on the shelf there were 
                        <lb n="31559"/>eggs. They would be for the breakfast in the morning after the 
                        <lb n="31560"/>communion in the college chapel. White pudding and eggs and 
                        <lb n="31561"/>sausages and cups of tea. How simple and beautiful was life 
                        <lb n="31562"/>after all! And life lay all before him. </p>
                    <lb n="31563"/><p> In a dream he fell asleep. In a dream he rose and saw that it 
                        <lb n="31564"/>was morning. In a waking dream he went through the quiet 
                        <lb n="31565"/>morning towards the college. </p>
                    <lb n="31566"/><p> The boys were all there, kneeling in their places. He knelt 
                        <lb n="31567"/>among them, happy and shy. The altar was heaped with fra- 
                        <lb n="31568"/>grant masses of white flowers: and in the morning light the pale 
                        <lb n="31569"/>flames of the candles among the white flowers were clear and 
                        <lb n="31570"/>silent as his own soul. </p>
                    <lb n="31571"/><p> He knelt before the altar with his classmates, holding the 
                        <lb n="31572"/>altar cloth with them over a living rail of hands. His hands 
                        <lb n="31573"/>were trembling: and his soul trembled as he heard the priest 
                        <lb n="31574"/>pass with the ciborium from communicant to communicant.

                    <lb n="31576"/><p> Could it be? He knelt there sinless and timid: and he would 
                        <lb n="31577"/>hold upon his tongue the host and God would enter his purified 
                        <lb n="31578"/>body.

                        <lb n="31581"/>true. It was not a dream from which he would wake.  The past 
                        <lb n="31582"/>was past.

                    <lb n="40001"/><p> Sunday was dedicated to the mystery of the Holy Trinity, 
                        <lb n="40002"/>Monday to the Holy Ghost, Tuesday to the Guardian Angels, 
                        <lb n="40003"/>Wednesday to Saint Joseph, Thursday to the Most Blessed Sac-

                    <lb n="40006"/><p> Every morning he hallowed himself anew in the presence of 
                        <lb n="40007"/>some holy image or mystery. His day began with an heroic 
                        <lb n="40008"/>offering of its every moment of thought or action for the intentions 
                        <lb n="40009"/>tions of the sovereign pontiff and with an early mass. The raw 
                        <lb n="40010"/>morning air whetted his resolute piety; and often as he knelt 
                        <lb n="40011"/>among the few worshippers at the sidealtar, following with his 
                        <lb n="40012"/>interleaved prayerbook the murmur of the priest, he glanced up 
                        <lb n="40013"/>for an instant towards the vested figure standing in the gloom 
                        <lb n="40014"/>between the two candles which were the old and the new 
                        <lb n="40015"/>testaments and imagined that he was kneeling at mass in the 
                        <lb n="40016"/>catacombs. </p>
                    <lb n="40017"/><p> His daily life was laid out in devotional areas. By means of 
                        <lb n="40018"/>ejaculations and prayers he stored up ungrudgingly for the 
                        <lb n="40019"/>souls in purgatory centuries of days and quarantines and years; 
                        <lb n="40020"/>yet the spiritual triumph which he felt in achieving with ease so 
                        <lb n="40021"/>many fabulous ages of canonical penances did not wholly re- 
                        <lb n="40022"/>ward his zeal of prayer since he could never know how much 
                        <lb n="40023"/>temporal punishment he had remitted by way of suffrage for 
                        <lb n="40024"/>the agonising souls: and, fearful lest in the midst of the purga- 
                        <lb n="40025"/>torial fire, which differed from the infernal only in that it was 
                        <lb n="40026"/>not everlasting, his penance might avail no more than a drop of 
                        <lb n="40027"/>moisture, he drove his soul daily through an increasing circle of 
                        <lb n="40028"/>works of supererogation. </p>
                    <lb n="40029"/><p> Every part of his day, divided by what he regarded now as 
                        <lb n="40030"/>the duties of his station in life, circled about its own centre of 
                        <lb n="40031"/>spiritual energy. His life seemed to have drawn near to eternity; 
                        <lb n="40032"/>every thought, word and deed, every instance of consciousness 
                        <lb n="40033"/>could be made to revibrate radiantly in heaven: and at times his 
                        <lb n="40034"/>sense of such immediate repercussion was so lively that he 
                        <lb n="40035"/>seemed to feel his soul in devotion pressing like fingers the 
                        <lb n="40036"/>keyboard of a great cash register and to see the amount of his 
                        <lb n="40037"/>purchase start forth immediately in heaven, not as a number but 
                        <lb n="40038"/>as a frail column of incense or as a slender flower. </p>
                    <lb n="40039"/><p> The rosaries too which he said constantly - for he carried his 
                        <lb n="40040"/>beads loose in his trousers' pockets that he might tell them as 
                        <lb n="40041"/>he walked the streets - transformed themselves into coronals of 
                        <lb n="40042"/>flowers of such vague unearthly texture that they seemed to 
                        <lb n="40043"/>him as hueless and odourless as they were nameless. He offered 
                        <lb n="40044"/>up each of his three daily chaplets that his soul might grow 
                        <lb n="40045"/>strong in each of the three theological virtues, in faith in the 
                        <lb n="40046"/>Father Who had created him, in hope in the Son Who had 
                        <lb n="40047"/>redeemed him, and in love of the Holy Ghost Who had sanc- 
                        <lb n="40048"/>tified him, and this thrice triple prayer he offered to the Three 
                        <lb n="40049"/>Persons through Mary in the name of her joyful and sorrowful 
                        <lb n="40050"/>and glorious  mysteries. </p>
                    <lb n="40051"/><p> On each of the seven days of the week he further prayed that 
                        <lb n="40052"/>one of the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost might descend upon 
                        <lb n="40053"/>his soul and drive out of it day by day the seven deadly sins 
                        <lb n="40054"/>which had defiled it in the past; and he prayed for each gift on 
                        <lb n="40055"/>its appointed day, confident that it would descend upon him, 
                        <lb n="40056"/>though it seemed strange to him at times that wisdom and 
                        <lb n="40057"/>understanding and knowledge were so distinct in their nature 
                        <lb n="40058"/>that each should be prayed for apart from the others. Yet he 
                        <lb n="40059"/>believed that at some future stage of his spiritual progress this 
                        <lb n="40060"/>difficulty would be removed when his sinful soul had been 
                        <lb n="40061"/>raised up from its weakness and enlightened by the Third Person 
                        <lb n="40062"/>son of the Most Blessed Trinity. He believed this all the more, 
                        <lb n="40063"/>and with trepidation, because of the divine gloom and silence 
                        <lb n="40064"/>wherein dwelt the unseen Paraclete, Whose symbols were a 
                        <lb n="40065"/>dove and a mighty wind, to sin against Whom was a sin be- 
                        <lb n="40066"/>yond forgiveness, the eternal, mysterious secret Being to 
                        <lb n="40067"/>Whom, as God, the priests offered up mass once a year, robed 
                        <lb n="40068"/>in the scarlet of the tongues of fire. </p>
                    <lb n="40069"/><p> The imagery through which the nature and kinship of the 
                        <lb n="40070"/>Three Persons of the Trinity were darkly shadowed forth in the 
                        <lb n="40071"/>books of devotion which he read - the Father contemplating 
                        <lb n="40072"/>from all eternity as in a mirror His Divine Perfections and 
                        <lb n="40073"/>thereby begetting eternally the Eternal Son and the Holy Spirit 
                        <lb n="40074"/>proceeding out of Father and Son from all eternity - were easier 
                        <lb n="40075"/>of acceptance by his mind by reason of their august incompre- 
                        <lb n="40076"/>hensibility than was the simple fact that God had loved his soul 
                        <lb n="40077"/>from all eternity, for ages before he had been born into the 
                        <lb n="40078"/>world, for ages before the world itself had existed. He had 
                        <lb n="40079"/>heard the names of the passions of love and hate pronounced 
                        <lb n="40080"/>solemnly on the stage and in the pulpit, had found them set 
                        <lb n="40081"/>forth solemnly in books, and had wondered why his soul was 
                        <lb n="40082"/>unable to harbour them for any time or to force his lips to utter 
                        <lb n="40083"/>their names with conviction. A brief anger had often invested 
                        <lb n="40084"/>him but he had never been able to make it an abiding passion 
                        <lb n="40085"/>and had always felt himself passing out of it as if his very body 
                        <lb n="40086"/>were being divested with ease of some outer skin or peel. He 
                        <lb n="40087"/>had felt a subtle, dark and murmurous presence penetrate his 
                        <lb n="40088"/>being and fire him with a brief iniquitous lust: it too had 
                        <lb n="40089"/>slipped beyond his grasp leaving his mind lucid and indifferent. 
                        <lb n="40090"/>This, it seemed, was the only love and that the only hate his 
                        <lb n="40091"/>soul would harbour. </p>
                    <lb n="40092"/><p> But he could no longer disbelieve in the reality of love since 
                        <lb n="40093"/>God Himself had loved his individual soul with divine love 
                        <lb n="40094"/>from all eternity. Gradually, as his soul was enriched with 
                        <lb n="40095"/>spiritual knowledge, he saw the whole world forming one vast 
                        <lb n="40096"/>symmetrical expression of God's power and love. Life became a 
                        <lb n="40097"/>divine gift for every moment and sensation of which, were it 
                        <lb n="40098"/>even the sight of a single leaf hanging on the twig of a tree, his 
                        <lb n="40099"/>soul should praise and thank the Giver. The world for all its 
                        <lb n="40100"/>solid substance and complexity no longer existed for his soul 
                        <lb n="40101"/>save as a theorem of divine power and love and universality. So 
                        <lb n="40102"/>entire and unquestionable was this sense of the divine meaning 
                        <lb n="40103"/>in all nature granted to his soul that he could scarcely understand 
                        <lb n="40104"/>stand why it was in any way necessary that he should continue 
                        <lb n="40105"/>to live. Yet that was part of the divine purpose and he 
                        <lb n="40106"/>dared not question its use, he above all others who had sinned 
                        <lb n="40107"/>so deeply and so foully against the divine purpose. Meek and 
                        <lb n="40108"/>abased by this consciousness of the one eternal omnipresent 
                        <lb n="40109"/>perfect reality his soul took up again her burden of pieties, 
                        <lb n="40110"/>masses and prayers and sacraments and mortifications, and 
                        <lb n="40111"/>only then for the first time since he had brooded on the great 
                        <lb n="40112"/>mystery of love did he feel within him a warm movement like 
                        <lb n="40113"/>that of some newly born life or virtue of the soul itself. The 
                        <lb n="40114"/>attitude of rapture in sacred art, the raised and parted hands, 
                        <lb n="40115"/>the parted lips and eyes as of one about to swoon, became for 
                        <lb n="40116"/>him an image of the soul in prayer, humiliated and faint before 
                        <lb n="40117"/>her Creator. </p>
                    <lb n="40118"/><p> But he had been forewarned of the dangers of spiritual exal- 
                        <lb n="40119"/>tation and did not allow himself to desist from even the least or 
                        <lb n="40120"/>lowliest devotion,  striving also by constant mortification to 
                        <lb n="40121"/>undo the sinful past rather than to achieve a saintliness fraught 
                        <lb n="40122"/>with peril. Each of his senses was brought under a rigorous 
                        <lb n="40123"/>discipline. In order to mortify the sense of sight he made it his 
                        <lb n="40124"/>rule to walk in the street with downcast eyes, glancing neither 
                        <lb n="40125"/>to right nor left and never behind him. His eyes shunned every 
                        <lb n="40126"/>encounter with the eyes of women. From time to time also he 
                        <lb n="40127"/>balked them by a sudden effort of the will, as by lifting them 
                        <lb n="40128"/>suddenly in the middle of an unfinished sentence and closing 
                        <lb n="40129"/>the book. To mortify his hearing he exerted no control over his 
                        <lb n="40130"/>voice which was then breaking, neither sang nor whistled and 
                        <lb n="40131"/>made no attempt to flee from noises which caused him painful 
                        <lb n="40132"/>nervous irritation such as the sharpening of knives on the 
                        <lb n="40133"/>knifeboard, the gathering of cinders on the fireshovel and the 
                        <lb n="40134"/>twigging of the carpet. To mortify his smell was more difficult 
                        <lb n="40135"/>as he found in himself no instinctive repugnance to bad odours, 
                        <lb n="40136"/>whether they were the odours of the outdoor world such as 
                        <lb n="40137"/>those of dung and tar or the odours of his own person among 
                        <lb n="40138"/>which he had made many curious comparisons and experiments. 
                        <lb n="40139"/>ments. He found in the end that the only odour against which 
                        <lb n="40140"/>his sense of smell revolted was a certain stale fishy stink like 
                        <lb n="40141"/>that of longstanding urine: and whenever it was possible he 
                        <lb n="40142"/>subjected himself to this unpleasant odour. To mortify the taste 
                        <lb n="40143"/>he practised strict habits at table, observed to the letter all the 
                        <lb n="40144"/>fasts of the church and sought by distraction to divert his mind 
                        <lb n="40145"/>from the savours of different foods. But it was to the mortification 
                        <lb n="40146"/>cation of touch that he brought the most assiduous ingenuity of 
                        <lb n="40147"/>inventiveness. He never consciously changed his position in 
                        <lb n="40148"/>bed, sat in the most uncomfortable positions, suffered patiently 
                        <lb n="40149"/>every itch and pain, kept away from the fire, remained on his 
                        <lb n="40150"/>knees all through the mass except at the gospels, left parts of 
                        <lb n="40151"/>his neck and face undried so that air might sting them and, 
                        <lb n="40152"/>whenever he was not saying his beads, carried his arms stiffly 
                        <lb n="40153"/>at his sides like a runner and never in his pockets or clasped 
                        <lb n="40154"/>behind him. </p>
                    <lb n="40155"/><p> He had no temptations to sin mortally. It surprised him 
                        <lb n="40156"/>however to find that at the end of his course of intricate piety 
                        <lb n="40157"/>and selfrestraint he was so easily at the mercy of childish and 
                        <lb n="40158"/>unworthy imperfections. His prayers and fasts availed him little 
                        <lb n="40159"/>for the suppression of anger at hearing his mother sneeze or at 
                        <lb n="40160"/>being disturbed in his devotions. It needed an immense effort of 
                        <lb n="40161"/>his will to master the impulse which urged him to give outlet to 
                        <lb n="40162"/>such irritation. Images of the outbursts of trivial anger which 
                        <lb n="40163"/>he had often noted among his masters, their twitching mouths, 
                        <lb n="40164"/>closeshut lips and flushed cheeks, recurred to his memory, dis- 
                        <lb n="40165"/>couraging him, for all his practice of humility, by the comparison. 
                        <lb n="40166"/>son. To merge his life in the common tide of other lives was 
                        <lb n="40167"/>harder for him than any fasting or prayer, and it was his 
                        <lb n="40168"/>constant failure to do this to his own satisfaction which caused 
                        <lb n="40169"/>in his soul at last a sensation of spiritual dryness together with 
                        <lb n="40170"/>a growth of doubts and  scruples. His soul traversed a period of 
                        <lb n="40171"/>desolation in which the sacraments themselves seemed to have 
                        <lb n="40172"/>turned into dried up sources. His confession became a channel 
                        <lb n="40173"/>for the escape of scrupulous and unrepented imperfections. His 
                        <lb n="40174"/>actual reception of the eucharist did not bring him the same 
                        <lb n="40175"/>dissolving moments of virginal selfsurrender as did those spiritual 
                        <lb n="40176"/>tual communions made by him sometimes at the close of some 
                        <lb n="40177"/>visit to the Blessed Sacrament. The book which he used for 
                        <lb n="40178"/>these visits was an old neglected book written by saint Alphonsus 
                        <lb n="40179"/>sus Liguori, with fading characters and sere foxpapered leaves. 
                        <lb n="40180"/>A faded world of fervent love and virginal responses seemed to 
                        <lb n="40181"/>be evoked for his soul by the reading of its pages in which the 
                        <lb n="40182"/>imagery of the canticles was interwoven with the communicant's 
                        <lb n="40183"/>cant's prayers. An inaudible voice seemed to caress the soul, 
                        <lb n="40184"/>telling her names and glories, bidding her arise as for espousal 
                        <lb n="40185"/>and come away, bidding her look forth, a spouse, from Amana 
                        <lb n="40186"/>and from the mountains of the leopards; and the soul seemed to 
                        <lb n="40187"/>answer with the same inaudible voice, surrendering herself: </p>
                    <lb n="40188"/><p> <seg xml:lang="la">Inter ubera mea commorabitur</seg>. </p>
                    <lb n="40189"/><p> This idea of surrender had a perilous attraction for his mind 
                        <lb n="40190"/>now that he felt his soul beset once again by the insistent voices 
                        <lb n="40191"/>of the flesh which began to murmur to him again during his 
                        <lb n="40192"/>prayers and meditations. It gave him an intense sense of power 
                        <lb n="40193"/>to know that he  could by a single act of consent, in a moment 
                        <lb n="40194"/>of thought, undo all that he had done. He seemed to feel a 
                        <lb n="40195"/>flood slowly advancing towards his naked feet and to be waiting 
                        <lb n="40196"/>ing for the first faint timid noiseless wavelet to touch his 
                        <lb n="40197"/>fevered skin. Then, almost at the instant of that touch, almost 
                        <lb n="40198"/>at the verge of sinful consent, he found himself standing far 
                        <lb n="40199"/>away from the flood upon a dry shore, saved by a sudden act of 
                        <lb n="40200"/>the will or a sudden ejaculation: and, seeing the silver line of 
                        <lb n="40201"/>the flood far away and beginning again its slow advance to- 
                        <lb n="40202"/>wards his feet, a new thrill of power and satisfaction shook his 
                        <lb n="40203"/>soul to know that he had not yielded nor undone all. </p>
                    <lb n="40204"/><p> When he had eluded the flood of temptation many times in 
                        <lb n="40205"/>this way he grew troubled and wondered whether the grace 
                        <lb n="40206"/>which he had refused to lose was not being filched from him 
                        <lb n="40207"/>little by little. The clear certitude of his own immunity grew 
                        <lb n="40208"/>dim and to it succeeded a vague fear that his soul had really 
                        <lb n="40209"/>fallen unawares. It was with difficulty that he won back his old 
                        <lb n="40210"/>consciousness of his state of grace by telling himself that he had 
                        <lb n="40211"/>prayed to God at every temptation and that the grace which he 
                        <lb n="40212"/>had prayed for must have been given to him inasmuch as God 
                        <lb n="40213"/>was obliged to give it. The very frequency and violence of 
                        <lb n="40214"/>temptations showed him at last the truth of what he had heard 
                        <lb n="40215"/>about the trials of the saints. Frequent and violent temptations 
                        <lb n="40216"/>were a proof that the citadel of the soul had not fallen and that 
                        <lb n="40217"/>the devil raged to make it fall. </p>
                    <lb n="40218"/><p> Often when he had confessed his doubts and scruples, some 
                        <lb n="40219"/>momentary inattention at prayer, a movement of trivial anger 
                        <lb n="40220"/>in his soul or a subtle wilfulness in speech or act, he was bidden 
                        <lb n="40221"/>by his confessor to name some sin of his past life before absolution 
                        <lb n="40222"/>ution was given him. He named it with humility and shame and 
                        <lb n="40223"/>repented of it once more. It humiliated and shamed him to 
                        <lb n="40224"/>think that he would never be freed from it wholly, however 
                        <lb n="40225"/>holily he might live or whatever virtues or perfections he might 
                        <lb n="40226"/>attain. A restless feeling of guilt would always be present with 
                        <lb n="40227"/>him: he would confess and repent and be absolved, confess and 
                        <lb n="40228"/>repent again and be absolved again, fruitlessly. Perhaps that 
                        <lb n="40229"/>first hasty confession wrung from him by the fear of hell had 
                        <lb n="40230"/>not been good? Perhaps, concerned only for his imminent 
                        <lb n="40231"/>doom, he had not had sincere sorrow for his sin? But the surest 
                        <lb n="40232"/>sign that his confession had been good and that he had had 
                        <lb n="40233"/>sincere sorrow for his sin was, he knew, the amendment of his 
                        <lb n="40234"/>life.

                    <lb n="40236"/><p> The director stood in the embrasure of the window, his back 
                        <lb n="40237"/>to the light, leaning an elbow on the brown crossblind and, as 
                        <lb n="40238"/>he spoke and smiled, slowly dangling and looping the cord of 
                        <lb n="40239"/>the other blind. Stephen stood before him, following for a mo- 
                        <lb n="40240"/>ment with his eyes the waning of the long summer daylight 
                        <lb n="40241"/>above the roofs or the slow deft movements of the priestly 
                        <lb n="40242"/>fingers. The priest's face was in total shadow but the waning 
                        <lb n="40243"/>daylight from behind him touched the deeply grooved temples 
                        <lb n="40244"/>and the curves of the skull. Stephen followed also with his ears 
                        <lb n="40245"/>the accents and intervals of the priest's voice as he spoke 
                        <lb n="40246"/>gravely and cordially of indifferent themes, the vacation which 
                        <lb n="40247"/>had just ended, the colleges of the order abroad, the transference 
                        <lb n="40248"/>ence of masters. The grave and cordial voice went on easily 
                        <lb n="40249"/>with its tale, and in the pauses Stephen felt bound to set it on 
                        <lb n="40250"/>again with respectful questions. He knew that the tale was a 
                        <lb n="40251"/>prelude and his mind waited for the sequel. Ever since the 
                        <lb n="40252"/>message of summons had come for him from the director his 
                        <lb n="40253"/>mind had struggled to find the meaning of the message; and 
                        <lb n="40254"/>during the long restless time he had sat in the college parlour 
                        <lb n="40255"/>waiting for the director to come in his eyes had wandered from 
                        <lb n="40256"/>one sober picture to another around the walls and his mind had 
                        <lb n="40257"/>wandered from one guess to another until the meaning of the 
                        <lb n="40258"/>summons had almost become clear. Then, just as he was wishing 
                        <lb n="40259"/>ing that some unforeseen cause might prevent the director from 
                        <lb n="40260"/>coming he had heard the handle of the door turning and the 
                        <lb n="40261"/>swish of a soutane. </p>
                    <lb n="40262"/><p> The director had begun to speak of the dominican and fran- 
                        <lb n="40263"/>ciscan orders and of the friendship between saint Thomas and 
                        <lb n="40264"/>saint Bonaventure. The capuchin dress, he thought, was rather 
                        <lb n="40265"/>too ....... </p>
                    <lb n="40266"/><p> Stephen's face gave back the priest's indulgent smile and, not 
                        <lb n="40267"/>being anxious to give an opinion, he made a slight dubitative 
                        <lb n="40268"/>movement with his lips. 
                        <lb n="40269"/><said who="the director">―I believe, continued the director, that there is some talk now 
                            <lb n="40270"/>among the capuchins themselves of doing away with it and 
                            <lb n="40271"/>following the example of the other franciscans. </said>

                        <lb n="40273"/><said who="the director">―O certainly, said the director. For the cloister it is all right 
                            <lb n="40274"/>but for the street I really think it would be better to do away 
                            <lb n="40275"/>with it, don't you? </said>
                        <lb n="40276"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―It must be troublesome, I imagine. </said>
                        <lb n="40277"/><said who="Priest">―Of course it is, of course. Just imagine when I was in Bel- 
                            <lb n="40278"/>gium I used to see them out cycling in all kinds of weather with 
                            <lb n="40279"/>this thing up about their knees! It was really ridiculous. <seg xml:lang="fr">Les

                    <lb n="40281"/><p> The vowel was so modified as to be indistinct.

                    <lb n="40285"/><p> Stephen smiled again in answer to the smile which he could 
                        <lb n="40286"/>not see on the priest's shadowed face, its image or spectre only 
                        <lb n="40287"/>passing rapidly across his mind as the low discreet accent fell 
                        <lb n="40288"/>upon his ear. He gazed calmly before him at the waning sky, 
                        <lb n="40289"/>glad of the cool of the evening and the faint yellow glow 
                        <lb n="40290"/>which hid the tiny flame kindling upon his cheek. </p>
                    <lb n="40291"/><p> The names of articles of dress worn by women or of certain 
                        <lb n="40292"/>soft and delicate stuffs used in their making brought always to 
                        <lb n="40293"/>his mind a delicate and sinful perfume. As a boy he had imagined 
                        <lb n="40294"/>ined the reins by which horses are driven as slender silken 
                        <lb n="40295"/>bands and it shocked him to feel at <place><location><geo>53.293003 -6.168866</geo></location><placeName>Stradbrook</placeName></place> the greasy 
                        <lb n="40296"/>leather of harness. It had shocked him too when he had felt for 
                        <lb n="40297"/>the first time beneath his tremulous fingers the brittle texture of 
                        <lb n="40298"/>a woman's stocking for, retaining nothing of all he read save 
                        <lb n="40299"/>that which seemed to him an echo or a prophecy of his own 
                        <lb n="40300"/>state, it was only amid softworded phrases or within rosesoft 
                        <lb n="40301"/>stuffs that he dared to conceive of the soul or body of a woman 
                        <lb n="40302"/>moving with tender life. </p>
                    <lb n="40303"/><p> But the phrase on the priest's lips was disingenuous for he 
                        <lb n="40304"/>knew that a priest should not speak lightly on that theme. The 
                        <lb n="40305"/>phrase had been spoken lightly with design and he felt that his 
                        <lb n="40306"/>face was being searched by the eyes in the shadow. Whatever 
                        <lb n="40307"/>he had heard or read of the craft of jesuits he had put aside 
                        <lb n="40308"/>frankly as not borne out by his own experience. His masters, 
                        <lb n="40309"/>even when they had not attracted him, had seemed to him 
                        <lb n="40310"/>always intelligent and serious priests, athletic and highspirited 
                        <lb n="40311"/>prefects. He thought of them as men who washed their bodies 
                        <lb n="40312"/>briskly with cold water and wore clean cold linen. During all 
                        <lb n="40313"/>the years he had lived among them in <place><location><geo>53.310601 -6.695541</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> 
                        and in <place><location><geo>52.207800 -8.211070</geo></location><placeName>Bel-
                                <lb n="40314"/>vedere</placeName></place> he had received only two pandies and, though these had 
                        <lb n="40315"/>been dealt him in the wrong, he knew that he had often escaped 
                        <lb n="40316"/>punishment. During all those years he had never heard from 
                        <lb n="40317"/>any of his masters a flippant word: it was they who had taught 
                        <lb n="40318"/>him christian doctrine and urged him to live a good life and, 
                        <lb n="40319"/>when he had fallen into grievous sin, it was they who had led 
                        <lb n="40320"/>him back to grace. Their presence had made him diffident of 
                        <lb n="40321"/>himself when he was a muff in Clongowes and it had made him 
                        <lb n="40322"/>diffident of himself also while he had held his equivocal 
                        <lb n="40323"/>position in Belvedere. A constant sense of this had remained 
                        <lb n="40324"/>with him up to the last year of his school life. He had never 
                        <lb n="40325"/>once disobeyed or allowed turbulent companions to seduce him 
                        <lb n="40326"/>from his habit of quiet obedience: and, even when he doubted 
                        <lb n="40327"/>some statement of a master, he had never presumed to doubt 
                        <lb n="40328"/>openly. Lately some of their judgments had sounded a little 
                        <lb n="40329"/>childish in his ears and had made him feel a regret and pity as 
                        <lb n="40330"/>though he were slowly passing out of an accustomed world and 
                        <lb n="40331"/>were hearing its language for the last time. One day when some 
                        <lb n="40332"/>boys had gathered round a priest under the shed near the 
                        <lb n="40333"/>chapel he had heard the priest say: </p>
                    <lb n="40334"/><p> ―I believe that Lord Macaulay was a man who probably never 
                        <lb n="40335"/>committed a mortal sin in his life, that is to say, a deliberate 
                        <lb n="40336"/>mortal sin. </p>
                    <lb n="40337"/><p> Some of the boys had then asked the priest if Victor Hugo 
                        <lb n="40338"/>were not the greatest French writer. The priest had answered 
                        <lb n="40339"/>that Victor Hugo had never written half so well when he had 
                        <lb n="40340"/>turned against the church as he had written when he was a 
                        <lb n="40341"/>catholic. 
                        <lb n="40342"/><said who="Priest">―But there are many eminent French critics, said the priest, 
                            <lb n="40343"/>who consider that even Victor Hugo, great as he certainly was, 
                            <lb n="40344"/>had not so pure a French style as Louis Veuillot.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="40345"/><p> The tiny flame which the priest's allusion had kindled upon 
                        <lb n="40346"/>Stephen's cheek had sunk down again and his eyes were still 
                        <lb n="40347"/>fixed calmly on the colorless sky. But an unresting doubt flew 
                        <lb n="40348"/>hither and thither before his mind. Masked memories passed 
                        <lb n="40349"/>quickly before him: he recognised scenes and persons yet he 
                        <lb n="40350"/>was conscious that he had failed to perceive some vital circumstance 
                        <lb n="40351"/>stance in them. He saw himself walking about the grounds 
                        <lb n="40352"/>watching the sports in <place><location><geo>53.348746 -6.275034</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> and eating slim jim out of his 
                        <lb n="40353"/>cricketcap. Some jesuits were walking round the cycletrack in 
                        <lb n="40354"/>the company of ladies. The echoes of certain expressions used 
                        <lb n="40355"/>in <place><location><geo>53.348746 -6.275034</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> sounded in remote caves of his mind. </p>
                    <lb n="40356"/><p> His ears were listening to these distant echoes amid the si- 
                        <lb n="40357"/>lence of the parlour when he became aware that the priest was 
                        <lb n="40358"/>addressing him in a different voice. </p>
                    <lb n="40359"/><p> ―I sent for you today, Stephen, because I wished to speak to 
                        <lb n="40360"/>you on a very important subject. </p>
                    <lb n="40361"/><p> ―Yes, sir. </p>
                    <lb n="40362"/><p> ―Have you ever felt that you had a vocation? </p>
                    <lb n="40363"/><p> Stephen parted his lips to answer yes and then withheld the 
                        <lb n="40364"/>word suddenly. The priest waited for the answer and added: </p>
                    <lb n="40365"/><p> ―I mean have you ever felt within yourself, in your soul, a 
                        <lb n="40366"/>desire to join the order. Think. </p>
                    <lb n="40367"/><p> ―I have sometimes thought of it, said Stephen. </p>
                    <lb n="40368"/><p> The priest let the blindcord fall to one side and, uniting his 
                        <lb n="40369"/>hands, leaned his chin gravely upon them, communing with 
                        <lb n="40370"/>himself. 
                        <lb n="40371"/><said who="Priest">―In a college like this,</said> he said at length, <said who="Priest">there is one boy or 
                            <lb n="40372"/>perhaps two or three boys whom God calls to the religious life. 
                            <lb n="40373"/>Such a boy is marked off from his companions by his piety, by 
                            <lb n="40374"/>the good example he shows to others. He is looked up to by 
                            <lb n="40375"/>them; he is chosen perhaps as prefect by his fellow sodalists. 
                            <lb n="40376"/>And you, Stephen, have been such a boy in this college, prefect 
                            <lb n="40377"/>of Our Blessed Lady's sodality. Perhaps you are the boy in this 
                            <lb n="40378"/>college whom God designs to call to Himself.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="40379"/><p> A strong note of pride reinforcing the gravity of the priest's 
                        <lb n="40380"/>voice made Stephen's heart quicken in response. </p>
                    <lb n="40381"/><p> ―To receive that call, Stephen, said the priest, is the greatest 
                        <lb n="40382"/>honour that the Almighty God can bestow upon a man. No 
                        <lb n="40383"/>king or emperor on this earth has the power of the priest 
                        <lb n="40384"/>of God. No angel or archangel in heaven, no saint, not even 
                        <lb n="40385"/>the Blessed Virgin herself has the power of a priest of God: the 
                        <lb n="40386"/>power of the keys, the power to bind and to loose from sin, the 
                        <lb n="40387"/>power of exorcism, the power to cast out from the creatures of 
                        <lb n="40388"/>God the evil spirits that have power over them, the power, the 
                        <lb n="40389"/>authority, to make the great God of Heaven come down upon 
                        <lb n="40390"/>the altar and take the form of bread and wine. What an awful 
                        <lb n="40391"/>power, Stephen! </p>
                    <lb n="40392"/><p> A flame began to flutter again on Stephen's cheek as he 
                        <lb n="40393"/>heard in this proud address an echo of his own proud musings. 
                        <lb n="40394"/>How often had he seen himself as a priest wielding calmly and 
                        <lb n="40395"/>humbly the awful power of which angels and saints stood in 
                        <lb n="40396"/>reverence! His soul had loved to muse in secret on this desire. 
                        <lb n="40397"/>He had seen himself, a young and silentmannered priest, en- 
                        <lb n="40398"/>tering a confessional swiftly, ascending the altarsteps, in- 
                        <lb n="40399"/>censing, genuflecting, accomplishing the vague acts of the 
                        <lb n="40400"/>priesthood which pleased him by reason of their semblance of 
                        <lb n="40401"/>reality and of their distance from it. In that dim life which he 
                        <lb n="40402"/>had lived through in his musings he had assumed the voices and 
                        <lb n="40403"/>gestures which he had noted with various priests. He had bent 
                        <lb n="40404"/>his knee sideways like such a one, he had shaken the thurible 
                        <lb n="40405"/>only slightly like such a one, his chasuble had swung open like 
                        <lb n="40406"/>that of such another as he had turned to the altar again after 
                        <lb n="40407"/>having blessed the people. And above all it had pleased him to 
                        <lb n="40408"/>fill the second place in those dim scenes of his imagining. He 
                        <lb n="40409"/>shrank from the dignity of celebrant because it displeased him 
                        <lb n="40410"/>to imagine that all the vague pomp should end in his own 
                        <lb n="40411"/>person or that the ritual should assign to him so clear and final 
                        <lb n="40412"/>an office. He longed for the minor sacred offices, to be vested 
                        <lb n="40413"/>with the tunicle of subdeacon at high mass, to stand aloof from 
                        <lb n="40414"/>the altar, forgotten by the people, his shoulders covered with a 
                        <lb n="40415"/>humeral veil, holding the paten within its folds, or, when the 
                        <lb n="40416"/>sacrifice had  been accomplished, to stand as deacon in a dal- 
                        <lb n="40417"/>matic of cloth of gold on the step below the celebrant, his 
                        <lb n="40418"/>hands joined and his face towards the people, and sing the 
                        <lb n="40419"/>chant <seg xml:lang="la">Ite, missa est</seg>. If ever he had seen himself celebrant it was 
                        <lb n="40420"/>as in the pictures of the mass in his child's massbook, in a 
                        <lb n="40421"/>church without worshippers, save for the angel of the sacrifice, 
                        <lb n="40422"/>at a bare altar and served by an acolyte scarcely more boyish 
                        <lb n="40423"/>than himself. In vague sacrificial or sacramental acts alone his 
                        <lb n="40424"/>will seemed drawn to go forth to encounter reality: and it was 
                        <lb n="40425"/>partly the absence of an appointed rite which had always con- 
                        <lb n="40426"/>strained him to inaction whether he had allowed silence to 
                        <lb n="40427"/>cover his anger or pride or had suffered only an embrace he 
                        <lb n="40428"/>longed to give. </p>
                    <lb n="40429"/><p> He listened in reverent silence now to the priest's appeal and 
                        <lb n="40430"/>through the words he heard even more distinctly a voice bid- 
                        <lb n="40431"/>ding him approach, offering him secret knowledge and secret 
                        <lb n="40432"/>power. He would know then what was the sin  of Simon Magus 
                        <lb n="40433"/>and what the sin against the Holy Ghost for which there was 
                        <lb n="40434"/>no forgiveness. He would know obscure things, hidden from 
                        <lb n="40435"/>others, from those who  were conceived and born children of 
                        <lb n="40436"/>wrath. He would know the sins, the sinful longings and sinful 
                        <lb n="40437"/>thoughts and sinful acts, of others, hearing them murmured 
                        <lb n="40438"/>into his ears in the confessional under the shame of a darkened 
                        <lb n="40439"/>chapel by the lips of women and of girls: but rendered immune 
                        <lb n="40440"/>mysteriously at his ordination by the imposition of hands his 
                        <lb n="40441"/>soul would pass again uncontaminated to the white peace of 
                        <lb n="40442"/>the altar. No touch of sin would linger upon the hands with 
                        <lb n="40443"/>which he would elevate and break the host; no touch of sin 
                        <lb n="40444"/>would linger on his lips in prayer to make him eat and drink 
                        <lb n="40445"/>damnation to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord. He 
                        <lb n="40446"/>would hold his secret knowledge and secret power, being as 
                        <lb n="40447"/>sinless as the innocent: and he would be a priest for ever 
                        <lb n="40448"/>according to the order of Melchisedec. </p>
                    <lb n="40449"/><p> ―I will offer up my mass tomorrow morning, said the director, 
                        <lb n="40450"/>tor, that Almighty God may reveal to you His holy will. And 
                        <lb n="40451"/>let you, Stephen, make a novena to your holy patron saint, the first 
                        <lb n="40452"/>martyr, who is very powerful with God, that God may en- 
                        <lb n="40453"/>lighten your mind. But you must be quite sure, Stephen, that 
                        <lb n="40454"/>you have a vocation because it would be terrible if you found 
                        <lb n="40455"/>afterwards that you had none. Once a priest always a priest, 
                        <lb n="40456"/>remember. Your catechism tells you that the sacrament of Holy 
                        <lb n="40457"/>Orders is one of those which can be received only once because 
                        <lb n="40458"/>it imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual mark which can 
                        <lb n="40459"/>never be effaced. It is before you must weigh well, not after. It 
                        <lb n="40460"/>is a solemn question, Stephen, because on it may depend the 
                        <lb n="40461"/>salvation of your eternal soul. But we will pray to God to-

                    <lb n="40463"/><p> He held open the heavy hall door and gave his hand as if 
                        <lb n="40464"/>already to a companion in the spiritual life. Stephen passed out 
                        <lb n="40465"/>on to  the wide platform above the steps and was conscious of 
                        <lb n="40466"/>the caress of mild evening air. Towards <place><location><geo>53.354445 -6.263812</geo></location><placeName>Findlater's church</placeName></place> a 
                        <lb n="40467"/>quartet of young men were striding along with linked arms, 
                        <lb n="40468"/>swaying their heads and stepping to the agile melody of their 
                        <lb n="40469"/>leader's concertina. The music passed in an instant, as the first 
                        <lb n="40470"/>bars of sudden music always did, over the fantastic fabrics of 
                        <lb n="40471"/>his mind, dissolving them painlessly and noiselessly as a sudden 
                        <lb n="40472"/>wave dissolves the sandbuilt turrets of children. Smiling at the 
                        <lb n="40473"/>trivial air he raised his eyes to the priest's face and, seeing in it 
                        <lb n="40474"/>a mirthless reflection of the sunken day, detached his hand 
                        <lb n="40475"/>slowly which had acquiesced  faintly in that companionship. </p>
                    <lb n="40476"/><p> As he descended the steps the impression which effaced his 
                        <lb n="40477"/>troubled selfcommunion was that of a mirthless mask reflecting 
                        <lb n="40478"/>a sunken day from the threshold of the college. The shadow, 
                        <lb n="40479"/>then, of the life of the college passed gravely over his consciousness. 
                        <lb n="40480"/>ness. It was a grave and ordered and passionless life that 
                        <lb n="40481"/>awaited him, a life without material cares. He wondered how 
                        <lb n="40482"/>he would pass the first night in the novitiate and with what 
                        <lb n="40483"/>dismay he would wake the first morning in the dormitory. The 
                        <lb n="40484"/>troubling odour of the long corridors of <place><location><geo>53.348746 -6.275034</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> came back 
                        <lb n="40485"/>to him and he heard the discreet murmur of the burning 
                        <lb n="40486"/>gasflames. At once from every part of his being unrest began to 
                        <lb n="40487"/>irradiate. A feverish quickening of his pulses followed and a din 
                        <lb n="40488"/>of meaningless words drove his reasoned thoughts hither and 
                        <lb n="40489"/>thither confusedly. His lungs dilated and sank as if he were 
                        <lb n="40490"/>inhaling a warm moist unsustaining air and he smelt again the 
                        <lb n="40491"/>warm moist air which hung in the bath in <place><location><geo>53.348746 -6.275034</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> above the 
                        <lb n="40492"/>sluggish turfcoloured water. </p>
                    <lb n="40493"/><p> Some instinct, waking at these memories, stronger than edu- 
                        <lb n="40494"/>cation or piety, quickened within him at every near approach 
                        <lb n="40495"/>to that life, an instinct subtle and hostile, and armed him 
                        <lb n="40496"/>against acquiescence. The chill and order of the life repelled 
                        <lb n="40497"/>him. He saw himself rising in the cold of the morning and filing 
                        <lb n="40498"/>down with the others to early mass and trying vainly to 
                        <lb n="40499"/>struggle with his prayers against the fainting sickness of his 
                        <lb n="40500"/>stomach. He saw himself sitting at dinner with the community 
                        <lb n="40501"/>of a college. What, then, had become of that deeprooted shyness of 
                        <lb n="40502"/>his which had made him loth to eat or drink under a strange 
                        <lb n="40503"/>roof? What had come of the pride of his spirit which had 
                        <lb n="40504"/>always made him conceive himself as a being apart in every 
                        <lb n="40505"/>order? </p>
                    <lb n="40506"/><p> The Reverend Stephen Dedalus, S.J. </p>
                    <lb n="40507"/><p> His name in that new life leaped into characters before his 
                        <lb n="40508"/>eyes and to it there followed a mental sensation of an unde- 
                        <lb n="40509"/>fined face or colour of a face. The colour faded and became 
                        <lb n="40510"/>strong like a changing glow of pallid brick red. Was it the raw 
                        <lb n="40511"/>reddish glow he had so often seen on wintry mornings on the 
                        <lb n="40512"/>shaven gills of the priests? The face was eyeless and sourfavoured 
                        <lb n="40513"/>voured and devout, shot with pink tinges of suffocated anger. 
                        <lb n="40514"/>Was it not a mental spectre of the face of one of the jesuits 
                        <lb n="40515"/>whom some of the boys called Lantern Jaws and others Foxy 
                        <lb n="40516"/>Campbell? </p>
                    <lb n="40517"/><p> He was passing at that moment before the <place><location><geo>53.358000 -6.259655</geo></location><placeName>jesuit house in 
                                <lb n="40518"/>Gardiner Street</placeName></place>, and wondered vaguely which window would 
                        <lb n="40519"/>be his if he ever joined the order. Then he wondered at the 
                        <lb n="40520"/>vagueness of his wonder, at the remoteness of his soul 
                        <lb n="40521"/>from what he had hitherto imagined her sanctuary, at the frail 
                        <lb n="40522"/>hold which so many years of order and obedience had of him 
                        <lb n="40523"/>when once a definite and irrevocable act of his threatened to 
                        <lb n="40524"/>end for ever, in time and in eternity, his freedom. The voice of 
                        <lb n="40525"/>the director urging upon him the proud claims of the church 
                        <lb n="40526"/>and the mystery and power of the priestly office repeated itself 
                        <lb n="40527"/>idly in his memory. His soul was not there to hear and greet it 
                        <lb n="40528"/>and he knew now that the exhortation he had listened to had 
                        <lb n="40529"/>already fallen into an idle formal tale. He would never swing 
                        <lb n="40530"/>the thurible  before the tabernacle as priest. His destiny was to 
                        <lb n="40531"/>be elusive of social or religious orders. The wisdom of the 
                        <lb n="40532"/>priest's appeal did not touch him to the quick. He was destined 
                        <lb n="40533"/>to learn his own wisdom apart from others or to learn the 
                        <lb n="40534"/>wisdom of others himself wandering among the snares of the 
                        <lb n="40535"/>world. </p>
                    <lb n="40536"/><p> The snares of the world were its ways of sin. He would fall. 
                        <lb n="40537"/>He had not yet fallen but he would fall silently, in an instant. 
                        <lb n="40538"/>Not to fall was too hard, too hard: and he felt the silent lapse 
                        <lb n="40539"/>of his soul, as it would be at some instant to come, falling, 
                        <lb n="40540"/>falling but not yet fallen, still unfallen but about to fall. </p>
                    <lb n="40541"/><p> He crossed the bridge over the stream of the <place><location><geo> 53.361845 -6.242480</geo></location><placeName>Tolka</placeName></place> and 
                        <lb n="40542"/>turned his eyes coldly for an instant towards the faded blue 
                        <lb n="40543"/>shrine of the Blessed Virgin which stood fowlwise on a pole in 
                        <lb n="40544"/>the middle of a hamshaped encampment of poor cottages. 
                        <lb n="40545"/>Then, bending to the left, he followed the lane which led up to 
                        <lb n="40546"/>his house. The faint sour stink of rotted cabbages came to- 
                        <lb n="40547"/>wards him from the kitchengardens on the rising ground above 
                        <lb n="40548"/>the river. He smiled to think that it was this disorder, the 
                        <lb n="40549"/>misrule and confusion of his father's house and the stagnation 
                        <lb n="40550"/>of vegetable life, which was to win the day in his soul. Then a 
                        <lb n="40551"/>short laugh broke from his lips as he thought of that solitary 
                        <lb n="40552"/>farmhand in the kitchengardens behind their house whom they 
                        <lb n="40553"/>had nicknamed the man with the hat. A second laugh, taking 
                        <lb n="40554"/>rise from the first after a pause, broke from him involuntarily 
                        <lb n="40555"/>as he thought of how the man with the hat worked, considering 
                        <lb n="40556"/>in turn the four points of the sky and then regretfully plunging 
                        <lb n="40557"/>his spade in the earth. </p>
                    <lb n="40558"/><p> He pushed open the latchless door of the porch and passed 
                        <lb n="40559"/>through the naked hallway into the kitchen. A group of his 
                        <lb n="40560"/>brothers and sisters was sitting round the table. Tea was nearly 
                        <lb n="40561"/>over and only the last of the second watered tea remained in 
                        <lb n="40562"/>the bottoms of the small glassjars and jampots which did ser- 
                        <lb n="40563"/>vice for teacups. Discarded crusts and lumps of sugared bread, 
                        <lb n="40564"/>turned brown by the tea which had been poured over them, lay 
                        <lb n="40565"/>scattered on the table. Little wells of tea lay here and there on 
                        <lb n="40566"/>the board and a knife with a broken ivory handle was stuck 
                        <lb n="40567"/>through the pith of a ravaged turnover. </p>
                    <lb n="40568"/><p> The sad quiet greyblue glow of the dying day came through 
                        <lb n="40569"/>the window and the open door, covering over and allaying 
                        <lb n="40570"/>quietly a sudden instinct of remorse in Stephen's heart. All that 
                        <lb n="40571"/>had been denied them had been freely given to him, the eldest: 
                        <lb n="40572"/>but the quiet glow of evening showed him in their faces no sign 
                        <lb n="40573"/>of rancour. </p>
                    <lb n="40574"/><p> He sat near them at the table and asked where his father and 
                        <lb n="40575"/>mother were. One answered: </p>
                    <lb n="40576"/><p> ―Goneboro toboro lookboro atboro aboro houseboro. </p>
                    <lb n="40577"/><p> Still another removal! A boy named Fallon in Belvedere had 
                        <lb n="40578"/>often asked him with a silly laugh why they moved so often. A 
                        <lb n="40579"/>frown of scorn darkened quickly his forehead as he heard again 
                        <lb n="40580"/>the silly laugh of the questioner. </p>
                    <lb n="40581"/><p> He asked: </p>
                    <lb n="40582"/><p> ―Why are we on the move again, if it's a fair question? </p>
                    <lb n="40583"/><p> The same sister answered: </p>
                    <lb n="40584"/><p> ―Becauseboro theboro landboro lordboro willboro putboro 
                        <lb n="40585"/>usboro outboro. </p>
                    <lb n="40586"/><p> The voice of his youngest brother from the farther side of 
                        <lb n="40587"/>the fireplace began to sing the air <emph>Oft in the Stilly Night</emph>. One 
                        <lb n="40588"/>by one the others took up the air until a full choir of voices was 
                        <lb n="40589"/>singing. They would sing so for hours, melody after melody, 
                        <lb n="40590"/>glee after glee, till the last pale light died down on the horizon, 
                        <lb n="40591"/>till the first dark nightclouds came forth and night fell. </p>
                    <lb n="40592"/><p> He waited for some moments, listening, before he too took 
                        <lb n="40593"/>up the air with them. He was listening with pain of spirit to the 
                        <lb n="40594"/>overtone of weariness behind their frail fresh innocent voices. 
                        <lb n="40595"/>Even before they set out on life's journey they seemed weary 
                        <lb n="40596"/>already of the way. </p>
                    <lb n="40597"/><p> He heard the choir of voices in the kitchen echoed and mul- 
                        <lb n="40598"/>tiplied through an endless reverberation of the choirs of endless 
                        <lb n="40599"/>generations of children: and heard in all the echoes an echo also 
                        <lb n="40600"/>of the recurring note of weariness and pain. All seemed weary 
                        <lb n="40601"/>of life even before entering upon it. And he remembered that 
                        <lb n="40602"/>Newman had heard this note also in the broken lines of Virgil 
                        <lb n="40603"/><emph>giving utterance, like the voice of Nature herself, to that pain 
                            <lb n="40604"/>and weariness yet hope of better things which has been the 
                            <lb n="40605"/>experience of her children in every time.</emph> </p>

                        <lb n="40616"/>could wait no longer. </p>

                        <lb n="40618"/>father's shrill whistle might call him back; and in a few mo- 
                        <lb n="40619"/>ments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was 
                        <lb n="40620"/>safe. </p>
                    <lb n="40621"/><p> Yes, his mother was hostile to the idea, as he  had read from 
                        <lb n="40622"/>her listless silence. Yet her mistrust pricked him more keenly 
                        <lb n="40623"/>than his father's pride and he thought coldly how he had 
                        <lb n="40624"/>watched the faith which was fading down in his soul aging and 
                        <lb n="40625"/>strengthening in her eyes. A dim antagonism gathered force 
                        <lb n="40626"/>within him and darkened his mind as a cloud against her dis- 
                        <lb n="40627"/>loyalty: and when it  passed, cloudlike, leaving his mind serene 
                        <lb n="40628"/>and dutiful towards her again, he was made aware dimly and 
                        <lb n="40629"/>without regret of a first noiseless sundering of their lives. </p>
                    <lb n="40630"/><p> The university! So he had passed beyond the challenge of the 
                        <lb n="40631"/>sentries who had stood as guardians of his boyhood and had 
                        <lb n="40632"/>sought to keep him among them that he might be subject to 
                        <lb n="40633"/>them and serve their ends. Pride after satisfaction uplifted him 
                        <lb n="40634"/>like long slow waves. The end he had been born to serve yet 
                        <lb n="40635"/>did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path: and now it 
                        <lb n="40636"/>beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was about to 
                        <lb n="40637"/>be opened to him. It seemed to him that he heard notes of fitful 
                        <lb n="40638"/>music leaping upwards a tone and downwards a diminished 
                        <lb n="40639"/>fourth, upwards a tone and downwards a major third, like 
                        <lb n="40640"/>triplebranching flames leaping fitfully, flame after flame, out of 
                        <lb n="40641"/>a midnight wood. It was an elfin prelude, endless and formless; 
                        <lb n="40642"/>and, as it grew wilder and faster, the flames leaping out of 
                        <lb n="40643"/>time, he seemed to hear from under the boughs and grasses 
                        <lb n="40644"/>wild creatures racing, their feet pattering like rain upon the 
                        <lb n="40645"/>leaves. Their feet passed in pattering tumult over his mind, the 
                        <lb n="40646"/>feet of hares and rabbits, the feet of harts and hinds and ante- 
                        <lb n="40647"/>lopes, until he heard them no more and remembered only a 
                        <lb n="40648"/>proud cadence from Newman: <emph>Whose feet are as the feet of 
                            <lb n="40649"/>harts and underneath the everlasting arms.</emph> </p>
                    <lb n="40650"/><p> The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the 
                        <lb n="40651"/>dignity of the office he had refused. All through his boyhood he 
                        <lb n="40652"/>had mused upon that which he had so often thought to be his 
                        <lb n="40653"/>destiny and when the moment had come for him to obey the 
                        <lb n="40654"/>call he had turned aside, obeying a wayward instinct. Now 
                        <lb n="40655"/>time lay between: the oils of ordination would never anoint his 
                        <lb n="40656"/>body. He had refused. Why? </p>
                    <lb n="40657"/><p> He turned seaward  from the road at <place><location><geo>53.365979 -6.174239</geo></location><placeName>Dollymount</placeName></place> and as he 
                        <lb n="40658"/>passed on to the thin wooden bridge he felt the planks shaking 
                        <lb n="40659"/>with the tramp of heavily shod feet. A squad of christian 
                        <lb n="40660"/>brothers was on its way back from the <place><location><geo>53.369769 -6.147334</geo></location><placeName>Bull</placeName></place> and had begun to 
                        <lb n="40661"/>pass, two by two, across the bridge. Soon the whole bridge was 
                        <lb n="40662"/>trembling and resounding. The uncouth faces passed him two 
                        <lb n="40663"/>by two, stained yellow or red or livid by the sea, and as he 
                        <lb n="40664"/>strove to look at them with ease and indifference, a faint stain 
                        <lb n="40665"/>of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face. 
                        <lb n="40666"/>Angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by 
                        <lb n="40667"/>gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under 
                        <lb n="40668"/>the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their topheavy 
                        <lb n="40669"/>silk hats, and humble tapelike collars and loosely hanging cleri- 
                        <lb n="40670"/>cal clothes.

                        <lb n="40677"/>humble and contrite hearts, it might be, paid a far richer tribute 
                        <lb n="40678"/>of devotion than his had ever been, a gift tenfold more acceptable 
                        <lb n="40679"/>able than his elaborate adoration. It was idle for him to move 
                        <lb n="40680"/>himself to be generous towards them, to tell himself that if he 
                        <lb n="40681"/>ever came to their gates, stripped of his pride, beaten and in 
                        <lb n="40682"/>beggar's weeds, that they would be generous towards him, 
                        <lb n="40683"/>loving him as themselves. Idle and embittering, finally,  to ar- 
                        <lb n="40684"/>gue, against his own dispassionate certitude, that the com-

                    <lb n="40688"/><p> He drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly 
                        <lb n="40689"/>to himself: </p>
                    <lb n="40690"/><p> ―A day of dappled seaborne clouds. </p>
                    <lb n="40691"/><p> The phrase and the day and the scene harmonised in a 
                        <lb n="40692"/>chord. Words. Was it their colours? He allowed them to glow 
                        <lb n="40693"/>and fade, hue after hue: sunrise gold, the russet and green of 
                        <lb n="40694"/>apple orchards, azure of waves, the greyfringed fleece of 
                        <lb n="40695"/>clouds. No, it was not their colours: it was the poise and 
                        <lb n="40696"/>balance of the period itself. Did he then love the rhythmic rise 
                        <lb n="40697"/>and fall of words better than their associations of legend and 
                        <lb n="40698"/>colour? Or was it that, being as weak of sight as he was shy of 
                        <lb n="40699"/>mind, he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing 
                        <lb n="40700"/>sensible world through the prism of a language manycoloured 
                        <lb n="40701"/>and richly storied than from the contemplation of an inner

                        <lb n="40705"/>At that instant, as it seemed to him, the air was chilled and 
                        <lb n="40706"/>looking askance towards the water he saw a flying squall dark- 
                        <lb n="40707"/>ening and crisping suddenly the tide. A faint click at his heart, a 
                        <lb n="40708"/>faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his flesh 
                        <lb n="40709"/>dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea: yet he did not 
                        <lb n="40710"/>strike across the downs on his left but held straight on along 
                        <lb n="40711"/>the spine of rocks that pointed against the river's mouth. </p>
                    <lb n="40712"/><p> A veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where 
                        <lb n="40713"/>the river was embayed. In the distance along the course of the 
                        <lb n="40714"/>slowflowing Liffey slender masts flecked the sky and, more 
                        <lb n="40715"/>distant still, the dim fabric of the city lay prone in haze. Like a 
                        <lb n="40716"/>scene on some vague arras, old as man's weariness, the image 
                        <lb n="40717"/>of the seventh city of christendom was visible to him across the 
                        <lb n="40718"/>timeless air, no older nor more weary nor less patient of subjection 
                        <lb n="40719"/>tion than in the days of the thingmote. </p>
                    <lb n="40720"/><p> Disheartened, he raised his eyes towards the slowdrifting 
                        <lb n="40721"/>clouds, dappled and seaborne. They were voyaging across the 
                        <lb n="40722"/>deserts of the sky, a host of nomads on the march, voyaging 
                        <lb n="40723"/>high over Ireland, westward bound. The Europe they had come

                        <lb n="40726"/>entrenched and marshalled races. He heard a confused music 
                        <lb n="40727"/>within him as of memories and names which he was almost 
                        <lb n="40728"/>conscious of but could not capture even for an instant; then the 
                        <lb n="40729"/>music seemed to recede, to  recede, to recede: and from each 
                        <lb n="40730"/>receding trail of nebulous music there fell always one long- 
                        <lb n="40731"/>drawn calling note, piercing like a star the dusk of silence. 
                        <lb n="40732"/>Again! Again! Again! Again! A voice from beyond the world 
                        <lb n="40733"/>was calling.

                        <lb n="40745"/>nakedness chilled him to the bone. Their bodies, corpsewhite 
                        <lb n="40746"/>or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the 
                        <lb n="40747"/>sun, gleamed with the wet of the sea. Their divingstone, poised 
                        <lb n="40748"/>on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges, and the 
                        <lb n="40749"/>roughhewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they 
                        <lb n="40750"/>scrambled in their horseplay, gleamed with cold wet lustre. The 
                        <lb n="40751"/>towels with which they smacked their bodies were heavy with 
                        <lb n="40752"/>cold seawater: and drenched with cold brine was their matted 
                        <lb n="40753"/>hair. </p>

                        <lb n="40755"/>banter with easy words. How characterless they looked: Shuley 
                        <lb n="40756"/>without his deep unbuttoned collar, Ennis without his scarlet 
                        <lb n="40757"/>belt with the snaky clasp, and Connolly  without his <place><location><geo>52.613969 0.886402</geo></location><placeName>Norfolk</placeName></place> 
                        <lb n="40758"/>coat with the flapless sidepockets!  It was a pain to see them and 
                        <lb n="40759"/>a swordlike pain to see the signs of adolescence that made 
                        <lb n="40760"/>repellent their pitiable nakedness. Perhaps they had taken refuge 
                        <lb n="40761"/>uge in number and noise from the secret dread in their souls. 
                        <lb n="40762"/>But he, apart from them and in silence, remembered in what 
                        <lb n="40763"/>dread he stood of the mystery of his own body. </p>

                        <lb n="40767"/>flattered his mild proud sovereignty. Now, as never before, his 
                        <lb n="40768"/>strange name seemed to him a prophecy. So timeless seemed 
                        <lb n="40769"/>the grey warm air, so fluid and impersonal his own mood, that 
                        <lb n="40770"/>all ages were as one to him. A moment before the ghost of 
                        <lb n="40771"/>the ancient kingdom of the Danes had looked forth through the 
                        <lb n="40772"/>vesture of the hazewrapped city. Now, at the name of the 
                        <lb n="40773"/>fabulous artificer, he seemed to hear the noise of dim waves 
                        <lb n="40774"/>and to see a winged form flying above the waves and slowly 
                        <lb n="40775"/>climbing the air. What did it mean? Was it a quaint device 
                        <lb n="40776"/>opening a page of some medieval book of prophecies and sym- 
                        <lb n="40777"/>bols, a hawklike man flying sunward above the sea, a prophecy 
                        <lb n="40778"/>of the end he had been born to serve and had been following 
                        <lb n="40779"/>through the mists of childhood and boyhood, a symbol of the 
                        <lb n="40780"/>artist forging anew in his workshop out of the sluggish matter 
                        <lb n="40781"/>of the earth a new soaring impalpable imperishable being? </p>
                    <lb n="40782"/><p> His heart trembled;  his breath came faster and a wild spirit 
                        <lb n="40783"/>passed over his limbs as though he were soaring sunward. His 
                        <lb n="40784"/>heart trembled in an ecstasy of fear and his soul was in flight. 
                        <lb n="40785"/>His soul was soaring in an air beyond the world and the body 
                        <lb n="40786"/>he knew was purified in a breath and delivered of incertitude 
                        <lb n="40787"/>and made radiant and commingled with the element of the 
                        <lb n="40788"/>spirit. An ecstasy of flight made radiant his eyes and wild his 
                        <lb n="40789"/>breath and tremulous and wild and radiant his windswept 
                        <lb n="40790"/>limbs.

                    <lb n="40797"/><p> His throat ached with a desire to cry aloud, the cry of a 
                        <lb n="40798"/>hawk or eagle on high, to cry piercingly of his deliverance to 
                        <lb n="40799"/>the winds. This was the call of life to his soul not the dull gross 
                        <lb n="40800"/>voice of the world of duties and despair, not the inhuman voice 
                        <lb n="40801"/>that had called him to the pale service of the altar. An instant 
                        <lb n="40802"/>of wild flight had delivered him and the cry of triumph which 
                        <lb n="40803"/>his lips withheld cleft his brain.

                    <lb n="40805"/><p> What were they now but cerements shaken from the body of 
                        <lb n="40806"/>death death - the fear he had walked in night and day, the incertitude 
                        <lb n="40807"/>that had ringed him round, the shame that had abased him 
                        <lb n="40808"/>within and without - cerements, the linens of the grave? </p>
                    <lb n="40809"/><p> His soul had arisen from the grave of boyhood, spurning her 
                        <lb n="40810"/>graveclothes. Yes! Yes! Yes! He would create proudly out of the 
                        <lb n="40811"/>freedom and power of his soul, as the great artificer whose 
                        <lb n="40812"/>name he bore, a living thing, new and soaring and beautiful, 
                        <lb n="40813"/>impalpable, imperishable. </p>
                    <lb n="40814"/><p> He started up nervously from the stoneblock for he could no 
                        <lb n="40815"/>longer quench the flame in his blood. He felt his cheeks aflame 
                        <lb n="40816"/>and his throat throbbing with song. There was a lust of wan- 
                        <lb n="40817"/>dering in his feet that burned to set out for the ends of the 
                        <lb n="40818"/>earth. On! On! his heart seemed to cry. Evening would deepen 
                        <lb n="40819"/>above the sea, night fall upon the plains, dawn glimmer before 
                        <lb n="40820"/>the wanderer and show him strange fields and hills and faces. 
                        <lb n="40821"/>Where? </p>
                    <lb n="40822"/><p> He looked northward towards <place><location><geo>53.378569 -6.057013</geo></location><placeName>Howth</placeName></place>. The sea had fallen 
                        <lb n="40823"/>below the line of seawrack on the shallow side of the breakwater 
                        <lb n="40824"/>water and already the tide was running out fast along the 
                        <lb n="40825"/>foreshore. Already one long oval bank of sand lay warm and 
                        <lb n="40826"/>dry amid the wavelets. Here and there warm isles of sand 
                        <lb n="40827"/>gleamed above the shallow tide, and about the isles and around 
                        <lb n="40828"/>the long bank and amid the shallow currents of the beach were 
                        <lb n="40829"/>lightclad gayclad figures, wading and delving. </p>
                    <lb n="40830"/><p> In a few moments he was barefoot, his stockings folded in 
                        <lb n="40831"/>his pockets and his canvas shoes dangling by their knotted laces 
                        <lb n="40832"/>over his shoulders: and, picking a pointed salteaten stick out of 
                        <lb n="40833"/>the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down the slope of 
                        <lb n="40834"/>the breakwater. </p>
                    <lb n="40835"/><p> There was a long rivulet in the <place><location><geo>53.366498 -6.147804</geo></location><placeName>strand</placeName></place>: and, as he waded 
                        <lb n="40836"/>slowly up its course, he wondered at the endless drift of sea- 
                        <lb n="40837"/>weed. Emerald and black and russet and olive, it moved 
                        <lb n="40838"/>beneath the current, swaying and turning. The water of the 
                        <lb n="40839"/>rivulet was dark with endless drift and mirrored the highdrifting 
                        <lb n="40840"/>ing clouds. The clouds were drifting above him silently and 
                        <lb n="40841"/>silently the seatangle was drifting below him; and the grey 
                        <lb n="40842"/>warm air was still: and a new wild life was singing in his veins. </p>
                    <lb n="40843"/><p> Where was his boyhood now? Where was the soul that had 
                        <lb n="40844"/>hung back from her destiny, to brood alone upon the shame of 
                        <lb n="40845"/>her wounds and in her house of squalor and subterfuge to 
                        <lb n="40846"/>queen it in faded cerements and in wreaths that withered at the 
                        <lb n="40847"/>touch? Or where was he? </p>
                    <lb n="40848"/><p> He was alone. He was unheeded, happy and near to the wild 
                        <lb n="40849"/>heart of life. He was alone and young and wilful and wild- 
                        <lb n="40850"/>hearted, alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish waters 
                        <lb n="40851"/>and the seaharvest of shells and tangle and veiled grey sunlight 
                        <lb n="40852"/>and gayclad lightclad figures, of children and girls and voices 
                        <lb n="40853"/>childish and girlish in the air. </p>
                    <lb n="40854"/><p> A girl stood before him in midstream, alone and still, gazing 
                        <lb n="40855"/>out to sea. She seemed like one whom magic had changed into 
                        <lb n="40856"/>the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird. Her long slender 
                        <lb n="40857"/>bare legs were delicate as a crane's and pure save where an 
                        <lb n="40858"/>emerald trail of seaweed had fashioned itself as a sign upon the 
                        <lb n="40859"/>flesh. Her thighs, fuller and softhued as ivory, were bared al- 
                        <lb n="40860"/>most to the hips where the white fringes of her drawers were 
                        <lb n="40861"/>like featherings of soft white down. Her slateblue skirts were 
                        <lb n="40862"/>kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her. Her 
                        <lb n="40863"/>bosom was as  a bird's soft and slight, slight and soft as the 
                        <lb n="40864"/>breast of some darkplumaged dove. But her long fair hair was 
                        <lb n="40865"/>girlish; and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal 
                        <lb n="40866"/>beauty, her face. </p>
                    <lb n="40867"/><p> She was alone and still, gazing out to sea; and when she felt 
                        <lb n="40868"/>his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him 
                        <lb n="40869"/>in quiet sufferance of his gaze, without shame or wantonness. 
                        <lb n="40870"/>Long, long she suffered his gaze and then quietly withdrew her 
                        <lb n="40871"/>eyes from his and bent them towards the stream, gently stirring 
                        <lb n="40872"/>the water with her foot hither and thither. The first faint noise 
                        <lb n="40873"/>of gently moving water broke the silence, low and faint and 
                        <lb n="40874"/>whispering, faint as the bells of sleep; hither and thither, hither 
                        <lb n="40875"/>and thither: and a faint flame trembled on her cheek. </p>
                    <lb n="40876"/><p> ―Heavenly God! cried Stephen's soul, in an outburst of pro- 
                        <lb n="40877"/>fane joy. </p>
                    <lb n="40878"/><p> He turned away from her suddenly and set off across the <place><location><geo>53.366498 -6.147804</geo></location><placeName> 
                                <lb n="40879"/>strand</placeName></place>. His cheeks  were aflame; his body was aglow; his limbs 
                        <lb n="40880"/>were trembling. On and on and on and on he strode, far out 
                        <lb n="40881"/>over the sands, singing wildly to the sea, crying to greet the 
                        <lb n="40882"/>advent of the life that had cried to him. </p>
                    <lb n="40883"/><p> Her image had passed into his soul for ever and no word had 
                        <lb n="40884"/>broken the holy silence of his ecstasy. Her eyes had called him 
                        <lb n="40885"/>and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to 
                        <lb n="40886"/>triumph, to recreate life out of life! A wild angel had appeared 
                        <lb n="40887"/>to him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy from 
                        <lb n="40888"/>the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an instant of 
                        <lb n="40889"/>ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory. On and on 
                        <lb n="40890"/>and on and on! </p>
                    <lb n="40891"/><p> He halted suddenly and heard his heart in the silence. How 
                        <lb n="40892"/>far had he walked? What hour was it? </p>
                    <lb n="40893"/><p> There was no human figure near him nor any sound borne 
                        <lb n="40894"/>to him over the air. But the tide was near the turn and already 
                        <lb n="40895"/>the day was on the wane. He turned landward and ran towards 
                        <lb n="40896"/>the shore and, running up the sloping beach, reckless of the 
                        <lb n="40897"/>sharp shingle, found a sandy nook amid a ring of tufted sand- 
                        <lb n="40898"/>knolls and lay down there that the peace and silence of the 
                        <lb n="40899"/>evening might still the riot of his blood. </p>
                    <lb n="40900"/><p> He  felt above him the vast indifferent dome and the calm 
                        <lb n="40901"/>processes of the heavenly bodies; and the earth beneath him, 
                        <lb n="40902"/>the earth that had borne him, had taken him to her breast. </p>
                    <lb n="40903"/><p> He closed his eyes in the languor of sleep. His eyelids 
                        <lb n="40904"/>trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth 
                        <lb n="40905"/>and her watchers, trembled as if they felt the strange light of 
                        <lb n="40906"/>some new world. His soul was swooning into some new world, 
                        <lb n="40907"/>fantastic, dim, uncertain as under sea, traversed by cloudy 
                        <lb n="40908"/>shapes and beings. A world, a glimmer, or a flower? Glimmering 
                        <lb n="40909"/>ing and trembling, trembling and unfolding, a breaking light, 
                        <lb n="40910"/>an opening flower, it spread in endless succession to itself, 
                        <lb n="40911"/>breaking in full crimson and unfolding and fading to palest 
                        <lb n="40912"/>rose, leaf by leaf and wave of light by wave of light, flooding all 
                        <lb n="40913"/>the heavens with its soft flushes, every flush deeper than other. </p>
                    <lb n="40914"/><p> Evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid 
                        <lb n="40915"/>grasses of his bed glowed no longer. He rose slowly and, re- 
                        <lb n="40916"/>calling the rapture of his sleep, sighed at its joy. </p>
                    <lb n="40917"/><p> He climbed to the crest of the sandhill and gazed about him. 
                        <lb n="40918"/>Evening had fallen. A rim of the young moon cleft the pale 
                        <lb n="40919"/>waste of sky like the rim of a silver hoop embedded in grey 
                        <lb n="40920"/>sand: and the tide was flowing in fast to the land with a low 
                        <lb n="40921"/>whisper of her waves, islanding a few last figures in distant 
                        <lb n="40922"/>pools. </p>

                        <lb n="50003"/>staring into the dark pool of the jar. The yellow dripping had

                        <lb n="50062"/>his heart already bitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness. 
                        <lb n="50063"/>His father's whistle, his mother's mutterings, the screech of an 
                        <lb n="50064"/>unseen maniac were to him now so many voices offending and 
                        <lb n="50065"/>threatening to humble the pride of his youth. He drove their 
                        <lb n="50066"/>echoes even out of his heart with an execration: but as he 
                        <lb n="50067"/>walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling 
                        <lb n="50068"/>about him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange

                    <lb n="50071"/><p> The rainladen trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always, 
                        <lb n="50072"/>memories of the girls and women in the plays of <persName>Gerhart 
                            <lb n="50073"/>Hauptmann</persName>: and the memory of their pale sorrows and the 
                        <lb n="50074"/>fragrance falling from the wet branches mingled in a mood of 
                        <lb n="50075"/>quiet joy. His morning walk across <place><location><geo>53.363150 -6.270676</geo></location><placeName>the city</placeName></place> had begun: and he 
                        <lb n="50076"/>foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of Fairview he would 
                        <lb n="50077"/>think of the cloistral silverveined prose of Newman, that as he

                        <lb n="50079"/>dows of the provision shops, he would recall the dark humour 
                        <lb n="50080"/>of <persName>Guido Cavalcanti</persName> and smile, that as he went by <persName>Baird</persName>'s

                        <lb n="50082"/>blow through him like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward boyish 
                        <lb n="50083"/>beauty, and that passing a grimy marine dealer's shop beyond 
                        <lb n="50084"/>the <placeName>Liffey</placeName> he would repeat the song by <persName>Ben Jonson</persName> which 
                        <lb n="50085"/>begins: </p>
                    <lb n="50086"/><lg> <l><emph>I was not wearier where I lay.</emph></l></lg> 
                    <lb n="50087"/><p> His mind when wearied of its search for the essence of 
                        <lb n="50088"/>beauty amid the spectral words of <persName>Aristotle</persName> or <persName>Aquinas</persName> turned 
                        <lb n="50089"/>often for its pleasure to the dainty songs of the Elizabethans. 
                        <lb n="50090"/>His mind, in the vesture of a doubting monk, stood often in 
                        <lb n="50091"/>shadow under the windows of that age, to hear the grave and 
                        <lb n="50092"/>mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter of waist- 
                        <lb n="50093"/>coateers until a laugh too low, a phrase, tarnished by time, of 
                        <lb n="50094"/>chambering and false honour stung his monkish pride and 
                        <lb n="50095"/>drove him on from his lurkingplace. </p>
                    <lb n="50096"/><p> The lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding 
                        <lb n="50097"/>upon so that it had rapt him from the companionships of youth 
                        <lb n="50098"/>was only a garner of slender sentences from <persName>Aristotle</persName>'s poetics 
                        <lb n="50099"/>and psychology and a <seg xml:lang="la">Synopsis Philosophiae Scholasticae ad 
                            <lb n="50100"/>mentem divi Thomae</seg>. His thinking was a dusk of doubt and 
                        <lb n="50101"/>selfmistrust lit up at moments by the lightnings of intuition, but 
                        <lb n="50102"/>lightnings of so clear a splendour that in those moments the 
                        <lb n="50103"/>world perished about his feet as if it had been fireconsumed: 
                        <lb n="50104"/>and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met the eyes of 
                        <lb n="50105"/>others with unanswering eyes for he felt that the spirit of 
                        <lb n="50106"/>beauty had folded him round like a mantle and that in revery at 
                        <lb n="50107"/>least he had been acquainted with nobility. But when this brief 
                        <lb n="50108"/>pride of silence upheld him no longer he was glad to find him- 
                        <lb n="50109"/>self still in the midst of common lives, passing on his way amid 
                        <lb n="50110"/>the squalor and noise and sloth of the city fearlessly and with a 
                        <lb n="50111"/>light heart. </p>
                    <lb n="50112"/><p> Near the hoardings on the canal he met the consumptive 
                        <lb n="50113"/>man with the doll's face and the brimless hat coming towards 
                        <lb n="50114"/>him down the slope of the bridge with little steps, tightly but- 
                        <lb n="50115"/>toned into his chocolate overcoat and holding his furled um- 
                        <lb n="50116"/>brella a span or two from him like a diviningrod. It must be 
                        <lb n="50117"/>eleven, he thought, and peered into a dairy to see the time. The 
                        <lb n="50118"/>clock in the dairy told him that it was five minutes to five but, 
                        <lb n="50119"/>as he turned away, he heard a clock somewhere near him but 
                        <lb n="50120"/>unseen beating eleven strokes in swift precision. He laughed as 
                        <lb n="50121"/>he heard it for it made him think of <persName>MacCann</persName> and he saw him 
                        <lb n="50122"/>a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breeches and with a fair 
                        <lb n="50123"/>goatee standing in the wind at <place><location><geo>53.351242 -6.260779</geo></location><placeName>Hopkins' corner</placeName></place>, and heard him 
                        <lb n="50124"/>say: 
                        <lb n="50125"/><said who="MacCann">―Dedalus, you're an antisocial being, wrapped up in yourself.

                    <lb n="50129"/><p> Eleven! Then he was late for that lecture too. What day of 
                        <lb n="50130"/>the week was it? He stopped at a newsagent's to read the 
                        <lb n="50131"/>headline of a placard. Thursday.  Ten to eleven; English: eleven 
                        <lb n="50132"/>to twelve; French: twelve to one; physics. He fancied to himself 
                        <lb n="50133"/>the English lecture and felt, even at that distance, restless and 
                        <lb n="50134"/>helpless. He saw the heads of his classmates meekly bent as 
                        <lb n="50135"/>they wrote in their notebooks the points they were bidden to 
                        <lb n="50136"/>note, nominal definitions, essential definitions and examples or 
                        <lb n="50137"/>dates of birth and death, chief works, a favourable and an 
                        <lb n="50138"/>unfavourable criticism side by side. His own head was unbent 
                        <lb n="50139"/>for his thoughts wandered abroad and whether he looked 
                        <lb n="50140"/>around the little class of students or out of the window across 
                        <lb n="50141"/>the desolate gardens of the green an odour assailed him of 
                        <lb n="50142"/>cheerless cellardamp and decay. Another head than his, right 
                        <lb n="50143"/>before him in the first benches, was poised squarely above its 
                        <lb n="50144"/>bending fellows like the head of a priest appealing without 
                        <lb n="50145"/>humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshippers about 
                        <lb n="50146"/>him. Why was it that when he thought of <persName>Cranly</persName> he could 
                        <lb n="50147"/>never raise before his mind the entire image of his body but 
                        <lb n="50148"/>only the image of the head and face? Even now against the grey 
                        <lb n="50149"/>curtain of the morning he saw it before him like the phantom 
                        <lb n="50150"/>of a dream, the face of a severed head or deathmask, crowned 
                        <lb n="50151"/>on the brows by its stiff black upright hair as by an iron crown. 
                        <lb n="50152"/>It was a priestlike face, priestlike in its pallor, in the wide- 
                        <lb n="50153"/>winged nose, in the shadowings below the eyes and along the 
                        <lb n="50154"/>jaws, priestlike in the lips that were long and bloodless and 
                        <lb n="50155"/>faintly smiling: and <persName>Stephen</persName>, remembering swiftly how he had 
                        <lb n="50156"/>told <persName>Cranly</persName> of all the tumults and unrest and longings in his 
                        <lb n="50157"/>soul, day after day and night by night only to be answered by 
                        <lb n="50158"/>his friend's listening silence, would have told himself that it 
                        <lb n="50159"/>was the face of a guilty priest who heard confessions of those 
                        <lb n="50160"/>whom he had not power to absolve but that he felt again in 
                        <lb n="50161"/>memory the gaze of its dark womanish eyes. </p>
                    <lb n="50162"/><p> Through this image he had a glimpse of a strange dark 
                        <lb n="50163"/>cavern of speculation but at once turned away from it feeling

                            <lb n="50315"/>her breast and her shoulders were bare. She asked me was I 
                            <lb n="50316"/>tired and would I like to stop the night there. She said she was 
                            <lb n="50317"/>all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that 
                            <lb n="50318"/>morning to <place><location><geo>53.273188 -6.092767</geo></location><placeName>Queenstown</placeName></place> with his sister to see her off. And all 
                            <lb n="50319"/>the time she was talking, <persName>Stevie</persName>, she had her eyes fixed on my 
                            <lb n="50320"/>face and she stood so close to me I could hear her breathing. 
                            <lb n="50321"/>When I handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to 
                            <lb n="50322"/>draw me in over the threshold and said: <emph>Come in and stay the 
                                <lb n="50323"/>night here. You've no call to be frightened. There's no-one in it

                            <lb n="50325"/>went on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the

                        <lb n="50355"/>of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street 
                        <lb n="50356"/>a slab was set to the memory of <persName>Wolfe Tone</persName> and he remem- 
                        <lb n="50357"/>bered having been present with his father at its laying. He re- 
                        <lb n="50358"/>membered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There 
                        <lb n="50359"/>were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling 
                        <lb n="50360"/>young man, held, wedged on a stick,  a card on which were 
                        <lb n="50361"/>printed the words: <seg xml:lang="fr">Vive l'Irlande!</seg> </p>
                    <lb n="50362"/><p> But the trees in <place><location><geo>53.338174 -6.259119</geo></location><placeName>Stephen's Green</placeName></place> were fragrant of rain and 
                        <lb n="50363"/>the rainsodden earth gave forth its mortal odour, a faint in- 
                        <lb n="50364"/>cense rising upward through the mould from many hearts. The 
                        <lb n="50365"/>soul of the gallant venal city which his elders had told him of 
                        <lb n="50366"/>had shrunk with time to a faint mortal odour rising from the 
                        <lb n="50367"/>earth and he knew that in a moment when he entered the 
                        <lb n="50368"/>sombre college he would be conscious of a corruption other 
                        <lb n="50369"/>than that of <persName>Buck Egan</persName> and <persName>Burnchapel Whaley</persName>. </p>
                    <lb n="50370"/><p> It was too late to go upstairs to the French class. He crossed 
                        <lb n="50371"/>the hall and took the corridor to the left which led to the 
                        <lb n="50372"/>physics theatre. The corridor was dark and silent but not un- 
                        <lb n="50373"/>watchful. Why did he feel that it was not unwatchful? Was it 
                        <lb n="50374"/>because he had heard that in <persName>Buck Whaley</persName>'s time there was a 
                        <lb n="50375"/>secret staircase there? Or was the jesuit house extraterritorial 
                        <lb n="50376"/>and was he walking among aliens? The <placeName>Ireland</placeName>of <persName>Tone</persName> and of 
                        <lb n="50377"/><persName>Parnell</persName> seemed to have receded in space. </p>
                    <lb n="50378"/><p> He opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly 
                        <lb n="50379"/>grey light that struggled through the dusty windows. A figure 
                        <lb n="50380"/>was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and 
                        <lb n="50381"/>greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the 
                        <lb n="50382"/>fire. Stephen closed the door quietly and approached the fire- 
                        <lb n="50383"/>place. 
                        <lb n="50384"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Good morning, sir! Can I help you?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50385"/><p> The priest looked up quickly and said: 
                        <lb n="50386"/><said who="???">―One moment now, Mr Dedalus, and you will see. There is 
                            <lb n="50387"/>an art in lighting a fire. We have the liberal arts and we have 
                            <lb n="50388"/>the useful arts. This is one of the useful arts. </said>
                        <lb n="50389"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I will try to learn it, said Stephen. </said>
                        <lb n="50390"/><said who="???">―Not too much coal, said the dean, working briskly at his 
                            <lb n="50391"/>task, that is one of the secrets.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50392"/><p> He produced four candle butts from the sidepockets of his 
                        <lb n="50393"/>soutane and placed them deftly among the coals and twisted 
                        <lb n="50394"/>papers. Stephen watched him in silence. Kneeling thus on the 
                        <lb n="50395"/>flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of 
                        <lb n="50396"/>his wisps of paper and candle butts he seemed more than ever a 
                        <lb n="50397"/>humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an empty 
                        <lb n="50398"/>temple, a levite of the Lord. Like a levite's robe of plain linen 
                        <lb n="50399"/>the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure of one 
                        <lb n="50400"/>whom the canonicals or the  bellbordered ephod would irk and 
                        <lb n="50401"/>trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service of the 
                        <lb n="50402"/>Lord – in tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing tidings se- 
                        <lb n="50403"/>cretly, in waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly when 
                        <lb n="50404"/>bidden – and yet had remained ungraced by aught of saintly or 
                        <lb n="50405"/>of prelatic beauty. Nay, his very soul had waxed old in that 
                        <lb n="50406"/>service without growing towards light and beauty or spreading 
                        <lb n="50407"/>abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity – a mortified will no more 
                        <lb n="50408"/>responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was to the thrill of 
                        <lb n="50409"/>love or combat his aging body, spare and sinewy, greyed with a 
                        <lb n="50410"/>silverpointed down. </p>
                    <lb n="50411"/><p> The dean rested back on his hunkers and watched the sticks 
                        <lb n="50412"/>catch. Stephen, to fill the silence, said: 
                        <lb n="50413"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I am sure I could not light a fire. </said>
                        <lb n="50414"/><said who="???">―You are an artist, are you not, Mr Dedalus? said the dean,

                            <lb n="50416"/>is the creation of the beautiful. What the beautiful is is another 
                            <lb n="50417"/>question.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50418"/><p> He rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty.

                    <lb n="50431"/><p> He rose nimbly and went towards the door, set it ajar and

                        <lb n="50435"/>brisk step, Stephen saw the silent soul of a jesuit look out at 
                        <lb n="50436"/>him from the pale loveless eyes. Like Ignatius he was lame but 
                        <lb n="50437"/>in his eyes burned no spark of Ignatius' enthusiasm. Even the 
                        <lb n="50438"/>legendary craft of the company, a craft subtler and more secret 
                        <lb n="50439"/>than its fabled books of secret subtle wisdom, had not fired his 
                        <lb n="50440"/>soul with the energy of apostleship. It seemed as if he used the 
                        <lb n="50441"/>shifts and lore and cunning of the world, as bidden to do, for 
                        <lb n="50442"/>the greater glory of God, without joy in their handling or 
                        <lb n="50443"/>hatred of that in them which was evil but turning them, with a 
                        <lb n="50444"/>firm gesture of obedience, back upon themselves: and for all 
                        <lb n="50445"/>this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all the master 
                        <lb n="50446"/>and little, if at all, the ends he served. <seg xml:lang="la">Similiter atque senis

                            <lb n="50480"/>stole the lamp. What did the philosopher do? He reflected that

                        <lb n="50485"/>of the words, bucket and lamp and lamp and bucket. The 
                        <lb n="50486"/>priest's voice too had a hard jingling tone. Stephen's mind 
                        <lb n="50487"/>halted by instinct, checked by the strange tone and the  imagery 
                        <lb n="50488"/>and by the priest's face which seemed like an unlit lamp or a 
                        <lb n="50489"/>reflector hung in a false focus. What lay behind it or within it? 
                        <lb n="50490"/>A dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the thundercloud, 
                        <lb n="50491"/>charged with intellection and capable of the gloom of God?

                            <lb n="50496"/>tradition or according to the tradition of the marketplace. I 
                            <lb n="50497"/>remember a sentence of Newman's in which he says of the 
                            <lb n="50498"/>Blessed Virgin that she was detained in the full company of the

                        <lb n="50525"/>the parable may have turned on the prodigal. A humble fol- 
                        <lb n="50526"/>lower in the wake of clamorous conversions,  a poor English- 
                        <lb n="50527"/>man in Ireland, he seemed to have entered on the stage of jesuit 
                        <lb n="50528"/>history when that strange play of intrigue and suffering and 
                        <lb n="50529"/>envy and struggle and indignity had been all but given through 
                        <lb n="50530"/>– a latecomer, a tardy spirit.  From what had he set out? Per- 
                        <lb n="50531"/>haps he had been born and bred among serious dissenters, 
                        <lb n="50532"/>seeing salvation in Jesus only and abhorring the vain pomps of 
                        <lb n="50533"/>the establishment. Had he felt the need of an implicit faith 
                        <lb n="50534"/>amid the welter of sectarianism and the jargon of its turbulent 
                        <lb n="50535"/>schisms, six principle men, peculiar people, seed and snake 
                        <lb n="50536"/>baptists, supralapsarian dogmatists? Had he found the true 
                        <lb n="50537"/>church all of a sudden in winding up to the end like a reel of

                        <lb n="50540"/>had Lord Christ touched him and bidden him follow, like that 
                        <lb n="50541"/>disciple who had sat at the receipt of custom, as he sat by the 
                        <lb n="50542"/>door of some zincroofed chapel, yawning and telling over his

                    <lb n="50549"/><p> The little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his 
                        <lb n="50550"/>sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe. He felt 
                        <lb n="50551"/>with a smart of dejection that the man to whom he was speak- 
                        <lb n="50552"/>ing was a countryman of Ben Jonson. He thought:

                            <lb n="50557"/>will always be for me an acquired speech. I have not made or 
                            <lb n="50558"/>accepted its words. My voice holds them at bay. My soul frets 
                            <lb n="50559"/>in the shadow of his language. </said>

                        <lb n="50566"/>was silent. The dean also was silent: and through the silence a 
                        <lb n="50567"/>distant noise of many boots and confused voices came up the

                        <lb n="50622"/>the spectrelike symbols of force and velocity fascinated and 
                        <lb n="50623"/>jaded Stephen's mind. He had heard some say that the old 
                        <lb n="50624"/>professor was an atheist freemason. O the grey dull day! It 
                        <lb n="50625"/>seemed a limbo of painless patient consciousness through 
                        <lb n="50626"/>which souls of mathematicians might wander, projecting long

                        <lb n="50629"/>ever vaster, farther and more impalpable.

                            <lb n="50632"/>of Mr W. S. Gilbert. In one of his songs he speaks of the 
                            <lb n="50633"/>billiard sharp who is condemned to play: 
                            <lg type="song">

                    <lb n="50639"/><p> Moynihan leaned down towards Stephen's ear and mur- 
                        <lb n="50640"/>mured: 
                        <lb n="50641"/><said who="Moynihan">―What price ellipsoidal balls! Chase me, ladies, I'm in the

                    <lb n="50643"/><p> His fellowstudent's rude humour ran like a gust through the 
                        <lb n="50644"/>cloister of Stephen's mind, shaking into gay life limp priestly 
                        <lb n="50645"/>vestments that hung upon the walls, setting them to sway and 
                        <lb n="50646"/>caper in a sabbath of misrule. The forms of the community 
                        <lb n="50647"/>emerged from the gustblown vestments, the dean of studies, 
                        <lb n="50648"/>the portly florid bursar with his cap of grey hair, the president, 
                        <lb n="50649"/>the little priest with feathery hair who wrote devout verses, the 
                        <lb n="50650"/>squat peasant form of the professor of economics, the tall form 
                        <lb n="50651"/>of the young professor of mental science discussing on the 
                        <lb n="50652"/>landing a case of conscience with his class like a giraffe crop- 
                        <lb n="50653"/>ping high leafage among a herd of antelopes, the grave troubled 
                        <lb n="50654"/>prefect of the sodality, the plump roundheaded professor of 
                        <lb n="50655"/>Italian with his rogue's eyes. They came ambling and stum- 
                        <lb n="50656"/>bling, tumbling and capering, kilting their gowns for leap frog, 
                        <lb n="50657"/>holding one another back, shaken with deep false laughter, 
                        <lb n="50658"/>smacking one another behind and laughing at their rude mal- 
                        <lb n="50659"/>ice, calling to one another by familiar nicknames, protesting 
                        <lb n="50660"/>with sudden dignity at some rough usage, whispering two and 
                        <lb n="50661"/>two behind their hands. </p>
                    <lb n="50662"/><p> The professor had gone to the glass cases on the sidewall 
                        <lb n="50663"/>from a shelf of which he took down a set of coils, blew away 
                        <lb n="50664"/>the dust from many points and, bearing it carefully to the table, 
                        <lb n="50665"/>held a finger on it while he proceeded with his lecture. He 
                        <lb n="50666"/>explained that the wires in modern coils were of a compound 
                        <lb n="50667"/>called platinoid lately discovered by F. W. Martino. </p>
                    <lb n="50668"/><p> He spoke clearly the initials and surname of the discoverer. 
                        <lb n="50669"/>Moynihan whispered from behind: 
                        <lb n="50670"/><said who="Moynihan">―Good old Fresh Water Martin! </said>
                        <lb n="50671"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Ask him, Stephen whispered back with weary humour, if he

                    <lb n="50673"/><p> Moynihan, seeing the professor bend over the coils, rose in 
                        <lb n="50674"/>his bench and, clacking noiselessly the fingers of his right hand, 
                        <lb n="50675"/>began to call with the voice of a slobbering urchin: 
                        <lb n="50676"/><said who="Moynihan">―Please, teacher! Please, teacher! This boy is after saying a 
                            <lb n="50677"/>bad word, teacher. </said>
                        <lb n="50678"/><said who="the professor">―Platinoid,</said> the professor said solemnly, <said who="the professor">is preferred to Ger-

                            <lb n="50681"/>sulated and the covering of silk that insulates it is wound 
                            <lb n="50682"/>double on the ebonite bobbins just where my finger is. If it

                    <lb n="50685"/><p> A sharp <place><location><geo>54.407332 -7.024250</geo></location><placeName>Ulster</placeName></place> voice said from the bench below Stephen: 
                        <lb n="50686"/><said who="???">―Are we likely to be asked questions on applied science?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50687"/><p> The professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure 
                        <lb n="50688"/>science and applied science. A heavybuilt student wearing gold 
                        <lb n="50689"/>spectacles stared with some wonder at the questioner. Moyni- 
                        <lb n="50690"/>han murmured from behind in his natural voice: 
                        <lb n="50691"/><said who="Moynihan">Isn't MacAlister a devil for his pound of flesh?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50692"/><p> Stephen looked down coldly on the oblong skull beneath 
                        <lb n="50693"/>him overgrown with tangled twinecoloured hair. The voice, the 
                        <lb n="50694"/>accent, the mind of the questioner offended him and he allowed 
                        <lb n="50695"/>the offence to carry  him towards wilful unkindness, bidding his 
                        <lb n="50696"/>mind think that the student's father would have done better 
                        <lb n="50697"/>had he sent his son to <place><location><geo>54.597285 -5.930120</geo></location><placeName>Belfast</placeName></place> to study and have saved some-

                    <lb n="50699"/><p> The oblong skull beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of 
                        <lb n="50700"/>thought and yet the shaft came back to its bowstring: for he 
                        <lb n="50701"/>saw in a moment the student's wheypale face. </p>
                    <lb n="50702"/><p><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―That thought is not mine,</said> he said to himself quickly. <said who="Stephen Dedalus">It came

                            <lb n="50705"/>bartered and its elect betrayed – by the questioner or  by the 
                            <lb n="50706"/>mocker? Patience. Remember Epictetus. It is probably in his 
                            <lb n="50707"/>character to ask such a question at such a moment in such a 
                            <lb n="50708"/>tone and to pronounce the word <emph>science</emph> as a monosyllable.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50709"/><p> The droning voice of the professor continued to wind itself 
                        <lb n="50710"/>slowly round and round the coils it spoke of, doubling, 
                        <lb n="50711"/>trebling, quadrupling its somnolent energy as the coil multi- 
                        <lb n="50712"/>plied its ohms of resistance. </p>
                    <lb n="50713"/><p> Moynihan's voice called from behind in echo to a distant 
                        <lb n="50714"/>bell: 
                        <lb n="50715"/><said who="Moynihan">―Closing time, gents!</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50716"/><p> The entrance hall was crowded and loud with talk. On a 
                        <lb n="50717"/>table near the door were two photographs in frames and be- 
                        <lb n="50718"/>tween them a long roll of paper bearing an irregular tail of 
                        <lb n="50719"/>signatures. MacCann went briskly to and fro among the stu- 
                        <lb n="50720"/>dents, talking rapidly, answering rebuffs and leading one after 
                        <lb n="50721"/>another to the table. In the inner hall the dean of studies stood 
                        <lb n="50722"/>talking to a young professor, stroking his chin gravely and nod- 
                        <lb n="50723"/>ding his head. </p>
                    <lb n="50724"/><p> Stephen, checked by the crowd at the door, halted irresol- 
                        <lb n="50725"/>utely. From under the wide falling leaf of a soft hat Cranly's 
                        <lb n="50726"/>dark eyes were watching him. 
                        <lb n="50727"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Have you signed?</said> Stephen asked.</p>
                    <lb n="50728"/><p> Cranly closed his long thinlipped mouth, communed with 
                        <lb n="50729"/>himself an instant and answered: 
                        <lb n="50730"/><said who="Cranly">―<seg xml:lang="la">Ego habeo.</seg> </said>
                        <lb n="50731"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―What is it for? </said>

                    <lb n="50734"/><p> Cranly turned his pale face to Stephen and said blandly and 
                        <lb n="50735"/>bitterly: 
                        <lb n="50736"/><said who="Cranly">―<seg xml:lang="la">Per pax universalis.</seg></said> </p>
                    <lb n="50737"/><p> Stephen pointed to the Czar's photograph and said: 
                        <lb n="50738"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―He has the face of a besotted Christ.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50739"/><p> The scorn and anger in his voice brought Cranly's eyes back 
                        <lb n="50740"/>from a calm survey of the walls of the hall. 
                        <lb n="50741"/><said who="Cranly">―Are you annoyed? he asked. </said>
                        <lb n="50742"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―No, answered Stephen. </said>
                        <lb n="50743"/><said who="Cranly">―Are you in bad humour? </said>
                        <lb n="50744"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―No.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50745"/><p> <said who="Cranly">―<seg xml:lang="la">Credo ut vos sanguinarius mendax estis</seg></said>, said Cranly, <said who="Cranly"><seg xml:lang="la">quia

                    <lb n="50747"/><p> Moynihan, on his way to the table, said in Stephen's ear: 
                        <lb n="50748"/><said who="Moynihan">―MacCann is in tiptop form. Ready to shed the last drop. 
                            <lb n="50749"/>Brandnew world. No stimulants and votes for the bitches.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50750"/><p> Stephen smiled at the manner of this confidence and, when 
                        <lb n="50751"/>Moynihan had passed, turned again to meet Cranly's eyes. 
                        <lb n="50752"/><said who="???">―Perhaps you can tell me,</said> he said, <said who="???">why he pours his soul so 
                            <lb n="50753"/>freely into my ear. Can you?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50754"/><p> A dull scowl appeared on Cranly's forehead. He stared at 
                        <lb n="50755"/>the table where Moynihan had bent to write his name on the 
                        <lb n="50756"/>roll, and then said flatly: 
                        <lb n="50757"/><said who="Cranly">―A sugar! </said>
                        <lb n="50758"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">">―<seg xml:lang="la">Quis est in malo humore</seg>,</said> said Stephen, <said who="Stephen Dedalus"><seg xml:lang="la">ego aut vos?</seg></said> </p>
                    <lb n="50759"/><p> Cranly did not take up the taunt. He brooded sourly on his 
                        <lb n="50760"/>judgment and repeated with the same flat force: 
                        <lb n="50761"/><said who="Cranly">―A flaming bloody sugar, that's what he is!</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50762"/><p> It was his epitaph for all dead friendships and Stephen won- 
                        <lb n="50763"/>dered whether it would ever be spoken in the same tone over 
                        <lb n="50764"/>his memory. The heavy lumpish phrase sank slowly out of 
                        <lb n="50765"/>hearing like a stone through a quagmire. Stephen saw it sink as 
                        <lb n="50766"/>he had seen many an other, feeling its heaviness depress his 
                        <lb n="50767"/>heart. Cranly's speech, unlike that of Davin, had neither rare 
                        <lb n="50768"/>phrases of Elizabethan English nor quaintly turned versions of 
                        <lb n="50769"/>Irish idioms. Its drawl was an echo of the quays of Dublin

                    <lb n="50773"/><p> The heavy scowl faded from Cranly's face as MacCann 
                        <lb n="50774"/>marched briskly towards them from the other side of the hall. 
                        <lb n="50775"/><said who="???">―Here you are! said MacCann cheerily. </said>

                        <lb n="50781"/>chocolate which peeped out of the propagandist's breastpocket. 
                        <lb n="50782"/>A little ring of listeners closed round to hear the war of wits. A 
                        <lb n="50783"/>lean student with olive skin and lank black hair thrust his face 
                        <lb n="50784"/>between the two, glancing from one to the other at each phrase 
                        <lb n="50785"/>and seeming to try to catch each flying phrase in his open moist 
                        <lb n="50786"/>mouth. Cranly took a small grey handball from his pocket and 
                        <lb n="50787"/>began to examine it closely, turning it over and over. 
                        <lb n="50788"/><said who="???">―Next business? said MacCann. Hom!</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50789"/><p> He gave a loud cough of laughter, smiled broadly and 
                        <lb n="50790"/>tugged twice at  the strawcoloured goatee which hung from his 
                        <lb n="50791"/>blunt chin.

                    <lb n="50795"/><p> The gipsylike student looked about him and addressed the 
                        <lb n="50796"/>onlookers in an indistinct bleating voice.

                    <lb n="50799"/><p> His voice faded into silence. No heed was paid to his words. 
                        <lb n="50800"/>He turned his olive face, equine in expression, towards Ste- 
                        <lb n="50801"/>phen, inviting him to speak again. </p>
                    <lb n="50802"/><p> MacCann began to speak with fluent energy of the Czar's

                        <lb n="50804"/>of international disputes, of the signs of the times, of the new

                    <lb n="50808"/><p> The gipsy student responded to the close of the period by 
                        <lb n="50809"/>crying:

                    <lb n="50816"/><p> Cranly gripped his arm tightly to check his tongue, smiling

                    <lb n="50843"/><p> Stephen blushed and turned aside. MacCann stood his

                    <lb n="50847"/><p> Cranly raised his head and held the handball between the

                    <lb n="50850"/><p> Stephen, moving away the bystanders, jerked his shoulder 
                        <lb n="50851"/>angrily in the direction of the Czar's image, saying: 
                        <lb n="50852"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Keep your icon. If we must have a Jesus let us have a legit-

                    <lb n="50857"/><p> He gulped down the spittle in his throat as if he were gulp-

                    <lb n="50862"/><p> Feeling himself jostled by the students near him, he said to

                    <lb n="50866"/><p> He turned again to Stephen and said in a whisper: 
                        <lb n="50867"/><said who="???">―Do you believe in Jesus? I believe in man. Of course, I don't 
                            <lb n="50868"/>know if you believe in man. I admire you, sir. I admire the 
                            <lb n="50869"/>mind of man independent of all religions. Is that your opinion 
                            <lb n="50870"/>about the mind of Jesus? </said>
                        <lb n="50871"/><said who="???">―Go on, Temple, said the stout ruddy student returning, as

                        <lb n="50873"/><said who="???">―He thinks I'm an imbecile, Temple explained to Stephen,

                    <lb n="50875"/><p> Cranly linked his arms into those of Stephen and his admirer 
                        <lb n="50876"/>and said:

                    <lb n="50878"/><p> Stephen, in the act of being led away, caught sight of 
                        <lb n="50879"/>MacCann's flushed bluntfeatured face. 
                        <lb n="50880"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―My signature is of no account,</said> he said politely. <said who="Stephen Dedalus">You are right

                    <lb n="50885"/><p> A voice said: 
                        <lb n="50886"/><said who="MacAlister">―Intellectual crankery is better out of this movement than in 
                            <lb n="50887"/>it.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50888"/><p> Stephen, recognising  the harsh tone of MacAlister's voice, 
                        <lb n="50889"/>did not turn in the direction of the voice. Cranly pushed sol- 
                        <lb n="50890"/>emnly through the throng of students, linking Stephen and 
                        <lb n="50891"/>Temple like a celebrant attended by his ministers on his way to 
                        <lb n="50892"/>the altar. </p>
                    <lb n="50893"/><p> Temple bent eagerly across Cranly's breast and said: 
                        <lb n="50894"/><said who="???">―Did you hear MacAlister what he said? That youth is jealous 
                            <lb n="50895"/>of you. Did you see that? I bet Cranly didn't see that. By hell, I 
                            <lb n="50896"/>saw that at once.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50897"/><p> As they crossed the inner hall the dean of studies was in  the

                        <lb n="50899"/>versing. He stood at the foot of the staircase, a foot on the 
                        <lb n="50900"/>lowest step, his threadbare  soutane gathered about him for 
                        <lb n="50901"/>the ascent with womanish care, nodding his head often and 
                        <lb n="50902"/>repeating:

                    <lb n="50904"/><p> In the middle of the hall the prefect of the college sodality 
                        <lb n="50905"/>was speaking earnestly, in a soft querulous voice, with a 
                        <lb n="50906"/>boarder. As he spoke he wrinkled a little his freckled brow and 
                        <lb n="50907"/>bit, between his phrases, at a tiny bone pencil. 
                        <lb n="50908"/><said who="???">―I hope the matric men will all come. The first arts men are

                    <lb n="50911"/><p> Temple bent again across Cranly, as they were passing 
                        <lb n="50912"/>through the doorway, and said in a swift whisper: 
                        <lb n="50913"/><said who="???">―Do you know that he is a married man? He was a married 
                            <lb n="50914"/>man before they converted him. He has a wife and children 
                            <lb n="50915"/>somewhere. By hell, I think that's the queerest notion I ever 
                            <lb n="50916"/>heard! Eh?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50917"/><p> His whisper trailed off into sly cackling laughter. The mo- 
                        <lb n="50918"/>ment they were through the doorway Cranly seized him rudely 
                        <lb n="50919"/>by the neck and shook him, saying:

                    <lb n="50923"/><p> Temple wriggled in his grip, laughing still with sly content, 
                        <lb n="50924"/>while Cranly repeated flatly at every rude shake:

                    <lb n="50926"/><p> They crossed the weedy garden together. The president, 
                        <lb n="50927"/>wrapped in a heavy loose cloak, was coming towards them 
                        <lb n="50928"/>along one of the walks, reading his office. At the end of the 
                        <lb n="50929"/>walk he halted before turning and raised his eyes. The students 
                        <lb n="50930"/>saluted, Temple fumbling as before at the peak of his cap. They 
                        <lb n="50931"/>walked forward in silence. As they neared the alley Stephen 
                        <lb n="50932"/>could hear the thuds of the players' hands and the wet smacks 
                        <lb n="50933"/>of the ball and Davin's voice crying out excitedly at each 
                        <lb n="50934"/>stroke. </p>
                    <lb n="50935"/><p> The three students halted round the box on which Davin sat 
                        <lb n="50936"/>to follow the game. Temple, after a few moments, sidled across 
                        <lb n="50937"/>to Stephen and said: 
                        <lb n="50938"/><said who="???">―Excuse me, I wanted to ask you do you believe that Jean 
                            <lb n="50939"/>Jacques Rousseau was a sincere man?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50940"/><p> Stephen laughed outright. Cranly, picking up the broken 
                        <lb n="50941"/>stave of a cask from the grass at his foot, turned swiftly and 
                        <lb n="50942"/>said sternly: 
                        <lb n="50943"/><said who="???">―Temple, I declare to the living God if you say another word,

                            <lb n="50949"/>flaming chamberpot as talking to Temple. Go home, Temple. 
                            <lb n="50950"/>For God' sake go home. </said>
                        <lb n="50951"/><said who="???">―I don't care a damn about you, Cranly, answered Temple, 
                            <lb n="50952"/>moving out of reach of the uplifted stave and pointing at Ste- 
                            <lb n="50953"/>phen. He's the only man I see in this institution that has an 
                            <lb n="50954"/>individual mind. </said>
                        <lb n="50955"/><said who="???">―Institution! Individual! cried Cranly. Go home, blast you, for 
                            <lb n="50956"/>you're a hopeless bloody man. </said>
                        <lb n="50957"/><said who="Temple">―I'm an emotional man, said Temple. That's quite rightly 
                            <lb n="50958"/>expressed. And I'm proud that I'm an emotionalist.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50959"/><p> He sidled out of the alley, smiling slily. Cranly watched him 
                        <lb n="50960"/>with a blank expressionless face. </p>
                    <p><said who="???">―Look at him!</said> he said. <said who="???">Did you ever see such a go-by-the- <lb n="50961"></lb>

                    <lb n="50963"/><p> His phrase was greeted by a strange laugh from a student 
                        <lb n="50964"/>who lounged against the wall, his peaked cap down on his eyes. 
                        <lb n="50965"/>The laugh, pitched in a high key and coming from a so muscu- 
                        <lb n="50966"/>lar frame, seemed like the whinny of an elephant. The student's 
                        <lb n="50967"/>body shook all over and, to ease his mirth, he rubbed both his 
                        <lb n="50968"/>hands delightedly over  his groins. 
                        <lb n="50969"/><said who="Cranly">―Lynch is awake,</said> said Cranly. </p>
                    <lb n="50970"/><p> Lynch, for answer, straightened himself and thrust forward 
                        <lb n="50971"/>his chest. 
                        <lb n="50972"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Lynch puts out his chest, said Stephen, as a criticism of life.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50973"/><p> Lynch smote himself sonorously on the chest and said: 
                        <lb n="50974"/><said who="Lynch">―Who has anything to say about my girth?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50975"/><p> Cranly took him at the word and the two began to tussle. 
                        <lb n="50976"/>When their faces had flushed with the struggle they drew apart, 
                        <lb n="50977"/>panting. Stephen bent down towards Davin who, intent on the 
                        <lb n="50978"/>game, had paid no heed to the talk of the others. 
                        <lb n="50979"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―And how is my little tame goose? he asked. Did he sign too?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50980"/><p> Davin nodded and said: 
                        <lb n="50981"/><said who="Davin">―And you, Stevie?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="50982"/><p> Stephen shook his head.

                    <lb n="50988"/><p> As Davin did not answer Stephen began to quote:

                        <lb n="51003"/><said who="Davin">―Then be one of us, said Davin. Why don't you learn Irish? 
                            <lb n="51004"/>Why did you drop out of the league class after the first lesson? </said>

                    <lb n="51010"/><p> Stephen paused and laid a friendly hand upon Davin's

                            <lb n="51020"/>private life, honest to God, Stevie, I was not able to eat my 
                            <lb n="51021"/>dinner. I was quite bad. I was awake a long time that night. 
                            <lb n="51022"/>Why did you tell me those things? </said>

                    <lb n="51051"/><p> Davin knocked the ashes from his pipe.

                    <lb n="51056"/><p> Davin rose from his box and went towards the players, 
                        <lb n="51057"/>shaking his head sadly. But in a moment his sadness left him 
                        <lb n="51058"/>and he was hotly disputing with Cranly and the two players 
                        <lb n="51059"/>who had finished their game. A match of four was arranged, 
                        <lb n="51060"/>Cranly insisting, however, that his ball should be used. He let it 
                        <lb n="51061"/>rebound twice or thrice to his hand and then struck it strongly 
                        <lb n="51062"/>and swiftly towards the base of the alley, exclaiming in answer 
                        <lb n="51063"/>to its thud:

                    <lb n="51065"/><p> Stephen stood with Lynch till the score began to rise. Then 
                        <lb n="51066"/>he plucked him by the sleeve to come away. Lynch obeyed, 
                        <lb n="51067"/>saying:

                    <lb n="51069"/><p> Stephen smiled at this sidethrust. They passed back through

                        <lb n="51071"/>was pinning up a notice in the frame. At the foot of the steps 
                        <lb n="51072"/>they halted and Stephen took a packet of cigarettes from his 
                        <lb n="51073"/>pocket and offered it to his companion.

                    <lb n="51076"/><p> This second proof of Lynch's culture made Stephen smile

                            <lb n="51097"/>had not seen for many years. At the corner of a street the shaft 
                            <lb n="51098"/>of a lorry shivered the window of the hansom in the shape of a 
                            <lb n="51099"/>star. A long fine needle of the shivered glass pierced her heart. 
                            <lb n="51100"/>She died on the instant. The reporter called it a tragic death. It 
                            <lb n="51101"/>is not. It is remote from terror and pity according to the terms 
                            <lb n="51102"/>of my definitions. </said>
                        <lb n="51103"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">The tragic emotion, in fact, is a face looking two ways,

                            <lb n="51105"/>it. You see I use the word <emph>arrest</emph>. I mean that the tragic emotion 
                            <lb n="51106"/>is static. Or rather the dramatic emotion is. The feelings ex- 
                            <lb n="51107"/>cited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire 
                            <lb n="51108"/>urges us to possess, to go to something, loathing  urges us to 
                            <lb n="51109"/>abandon, to go from something. These are kinetic emotions. 
                            <lb n="51110"/>The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are 
                            <lb n="51111"/>therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I use the general 
                            <lb n="51112"/>term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and raised above

                        <lb n="51128"/>before Stephen's mind the image of a hooded reptile. The eyes, 
                        <lb n="51129"/>too, were reptilelike in glint and gaze. Yet at that instant, 
                        <lb n="51130"/>humbled and alert in their look, they were lit by one tiny 
                        <lb n="51131"/>human point, the window of a shrivelled soul, poignant and 
                        <lb n="51132"/>selfembittered.

                            <lb n="51138"/>really not esthetic emotions not only because they are kinetic 
                            <lb n="51139"/>in character but also because they are not more than physical. 
                            <lb n="51140"/>Our flesh shrinks from what it dreads and responds to the 
                            <lb n="51141"/>stimulus of what it desires by a purely reflex action of the nerv-

                            <lb n="51148"/>awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which 
                            <lb n="51149"/>is purely physical. It awakens, or ought to awaken, or induces,

                            <lb n="51208"/>beauty is the splendour of truth. I don't think that it has a 
                            <lb n="51209"/>meaning but the true and the beautiful are akin. Truth is beheld 
                            <lb n="51210"/>by the intellect which is appeased by the most satisfying 
                            <lb n="51211"/>relations of the intelligible:  beauty is beheld by the imagination 
                            <lb n="51212"/>which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the sen- 
                            <lb n="51213"/>sible. The first step in the direction of truth is to understand the 
                            <lb n="51214"/>frame and scope of the intellect itself, to comprehend the act 
                            <lb n="51215"/>itself of intellection. Aristotle's entire system of philosophy 
                            <lb n="51216"/>rests upon his book of psychology and that, I think, rests on his 
                            <lb n="51217"/>statement that the same attribute cannot at the same time and

                            <lb n="51219"/>subject. The first step in the direction of beauty is to under- 
                            <lb n="51220"/>stand the frame and scope of the imagination, to comprehend

                            <lb n="51232"/>with the manifold functions of women for the propagation of 
                            <lb n="51233"/>the species. It may be so. The world, it seems, is drearier than

                            <lb n="51235"/>It leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic. It leads you out of 
                            <lb n="51236"/>the maze into a new gaudy lectureroom where MacCann, with

                            <lb n="51381"/>for a long time. It would lead you to believe that he had in 
                            <lb n="51382"/>mind symbolism or idealism, the supreme quality of beauty 
                            <lb n="51383"/>being a light from some other world, the idea of which the 
                            <lb n="51384"/>matter is but the shadow, the reality of which it is but the 
                            <lb n="51385"/>symbol. I thought he might mean that <seg xml:lang="la">claritas</seg> is the artistic 
                            <lb n="51386"/>discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything 
                            <lb n="51387"/>or a force of generalisation which would make the esthetic 
                            <lb n="51388"/>image a universal one, make it outshine its proper conditions. 
                            <lb n="51389"/>But that is literary talk. I understand it so. When you have

                            <lb n="51392"/>the only synthesis which is logically and esthetically permiss- 
                            <lb n="51393"/>ible. You see that it is that thing which it is and no other thing.

                            <lb n="51396"/>when the esthetic image is first conceived in his imagination.

                            <lb n="51400"/>luminously by the mind which has been arrested by its whole-

                            <lb n="51413"/>judgment is influenced in the first place by the art itself and by 
                            <lb n="51414"/>the form of that art. The image, it is clear, must be set between 
                            <lb n="51415"/>the mind or senses of the  artist himself and the mind or senses 
                            <lb n="51416"/>of others. If you bear this in memory you will see that art 
                            <lb n="51417"/>necessarily divides itself into three forms progressing from one 
                            <lb n="51418"/>to the next. These forms are: the lyrical form, the form wherein 
                            <lb n="51419"/>the artist presents his image in immediate relation to himself; 
                            <lb n="51420"/>the epical form, the form wherein he presents his image in 
                            <lb n="51421"/>mediate relation to himself and to others; the dramatic form, 
                            <lb n="51422"/>the form wherein he presents his image in immediate relation to

                        <lb n="51440"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Lessing, said Stephen, should not have taken a group of 
                            <lb n="51441"/>statues to write of. The art, being inferior, does not present the 
                            <lb n="51442"/>forms I spoke of distinguished clearly one from another. Even 
                            <lb n="51443"/>in literature, the highest and most spiritual art, the forms are 
                            <lb n="51444"/>often confused. The lyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal 
                            <lb n="51445"/>vesture of an instant of emotion, a rhythmical cry such as ages 
                            <lb n="51446"/>ago cheered on the man who pulled at the oar or dragged 
                            <lb n="51447"/>stones up a slope. He who utters it is more conscious of the 
                            <lb n="51448"/>instant of emotion than of himself as feeling emotion. The 
                            <lb n="51449"/>simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyrical literature 
                            <lb n="51450"/>when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as the centre 
                            <lb n="51451"/>of an epical event and this form progresses till the centre of 
                            <lb n="51452"/>emotional gravity is equidistant from the artist himself and 
                            <lb n="51453"/>from others. The narrative is no longer purely personal. The 
                            <lb n="51454"/>personality of the artist passes into the narration itself, flowing 
                            <lb n="51455"/>round and round the persons and the action like a vital sea. 
                            <lb n="51456"/>This progress you will see easily in that old English ballad 
                            <lb n="51457"/><emph>Turpin Hero</emph> which begins in the first person and ends in the 
                            <lb n="51458"/>third person. The dramatic form is reached when the vitality 
                            <lb n="51459"/>which has flowed and eddied round each person fills every 
                            <lb n="51460"/>person with such vital force that he or she assumes a proper 
                            <lb n="51461"/>and intangible esthetic life. The personality of the artist at first 
                            <lb n="51462"/>a cry or a cadence or a mood and then a fluid and lambent 
                            <lb n="51463"/>narrative finally refines itself out of existence, impersonalises 
                            <lb n="51464"/>itself, so to speak. The esthetic image in the dramatic form is 
                            <lb n="51465"/>life purified in and reprojected from the human imagination. 
                            <lb n="51466"/>The mystery of esthetic like that of material creation is accom- 
                            <lb n="51467"/>plished. The artist, like the God of the creation, remains within 
                            <lb n="51468"/>or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible, refined 
                            <lb n="51469"/>out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails. </said>

                    <lb n="51523"/><p> Towards dawn he awoke. O what sweet music! His soul was 
                        <lb n="51524"/>all dewy wet. Over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of light 
                        <lb n="51525"/>had passed. He lay still, as if his soul lay amid cool waters, 
                        <lb n="51526"/>conscious of faint sweet music. His mind was waking slowly to 
                        <lb n="51527"/>a tremulous morning knowledge, a morning inspiration. A 
                        <lb n="51528"/>spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as dew, moving 
                        <lb n="51529"/>as music. But how faintly it was inbreathed, how passionlessly 
                        <lb n="51530"/>as if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him! His 
                        <lb n="51531"/>soul was waking slowly, fearing to awake wholly. It was that 
                        <lb n="51532"/>windless hour of dawn when madness wakes and strange plants 
                        <lb n="51533"/>open to the light and the moth flies forth silently. </p>
                    <lb n="51534"/><p> An enchantment of the heart! The night had been enchanted. In 
                        <lb n="51535"/>dream or vision he had known the ecstasy of seraphic life. 
                        <lb n="51536"/>Was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and days 
                        <lb n="51537"/>and years and ages? </p>
                    <lb n="51538"/><p> The instant of inspiration seemed now to be reflected from 
                        <lb n="51539"/>all sides at once from a multitude of cloudy circumstance of 
                        <lb n="51540"/>what had happened or of what might have happened. The in- 
                        <lb n="51541"/>stant flashed forth like a point of light and now from cloud on 
                        <lb n="51542"/>cloud of vague circumstance confused form  was veiling softly 
                        <lb n="51543"/>its afterglow. O! In the virgin womb of the imagination the 
                        <lb n="51544"/>word was made flesh. Gabriel the  seraph had come to the 
                        <lb n="51545"/>virgin's chamber. An afterglow deepened within his spirit, 
                        <lb n="51546"/>whence the white flame had passed, deepening to a rose and 
                        <lb n="51547"/>ardent light. That rose and ardent light was her strange wilful 
                        <lb n="51548"/>heart, strange that no man had known or would know, wilful 
                        <lb n="51549"/>from before the beginning of the world: and lured by that 
                        <lb n="51550"/>ardent roselike glow the choirs of the seraphim were falling 
                        <lb n="51551"/>from heaven. </p>
                    <lg>

                    </lg>
                    <lb n="51555"/><p> The verses passed from his mind to his lips and, murmuring 
                        <lb n="51556"/>them over, he felt the rhythmic movement of a villanelle pass 
                        <lb n="51557"/>through them. The roselike glow sent forth its rays of rhyme; 
                        <lb n="51558"/>ways, days, blaze, praise, raise. Its rays burned up the world, 
                        <lb n="51559"/>consumed the hearts of men and angels: the rays from the rose 
                        <lb n="51560"/>that was her wilful heart. </p>

                        <lb n="51563"/><l>Are you not weary of ardent ways?</l> 
                    </lg>
                    <lb n="51564"/><p> And then? The rhythm died away, ceased, began again to 
                        <lb n="51565"/>move and beat. And then? Smoke, incense ascending from the 
                        <lb n="51566"/>altar of the world. </p>
                    <lg>
                        <lb n="51567"/><l>Above the flame the smoke of praise</l> 
                        <lb n="51568"/><l>Goes up from ocean rim to rim.</l> 
                        <lb n="51569"/><l>Tell no more of enchanted days.</l> 
                    </lg>
                    <lb n="51570"/><p> Smoke went up from the whole earth, from the vapoury 
                        <lb n="51571"/>oceans, smoke of her praise. The earth was like a swinging 
                        <lb n="51572"/>swaying smoking [swaying] censer, a ball of incense, an ellipsoidal ball. 
                        <lb n="51573"/>The rhythm died out at once; the cry of his heart was broken. 
                        <lb n="51574"/>His lips began to murmur the first verses over and over; then 
                        <lb n="51575"/>went on stumbling through half verses, stammering and 
                        <lb n="51576"/>baffled; then stopped. The heart's cry was broken. </p>
                    <lb n="51577"/><p> The veiled windless hour had passed and behind the panes 
                        <lb n="51578"/>of the naked window the morning light was gathering. A bell 
                        <lb n="51579"/>beat faintly very far away. A bird twittered; two birds, three. 
                        <lb n="51580"/>The bell and the birds ceased: and the dull white light  spread 
                        <lb n="51581"/>itself east and west, covering the world, covering the roselight 
                        <lb n="51582"/>in his heart. </p>
                    <lb n="51583"/><p> Fearing to lose all he raised himself suddenly on his elbow to 
                        <lb n="51584"/>look for paper and pencil. There was neither on the table; only 
                        <lb n="51585"/>the soup plate he had eaten the rice from for supper and the 
                        <lb n="51586"/>candlestick with its tendrils of tallow and its paper socket, 
                        <lb n="51587"/>singed by the last flame. He stretched his arm wearily towards 
                        <lb n="51588"/>the foot of the bed, groping with his hand in the pockets of the 
                        <lb n="51589"/>coat that hung there. His fingers found a pencil and then a 
                        <lb n="51590"/>cigarette packet.  He  lay back and, tearing open the packet, 
                        <lb n="51591"/>placed the last cigarette on the window ledge and began to 
                        <lb n="51592"/>write out the stanzas of the villanelle in small neat letters on the 
                        <lb n="51593"/>rough cardboard surface. </p>
                    <lb n="51594"/><p> Having written them out he lay back on the lumpy pillow, 
                        <lb n="51595"/>murmuring them again. The lumps of knotted flock under his 
                        <lb n="51596"/>head reminded him of the lumps of knotted horsehair in the 
                        <lb n="51597"/>sofa of her parlour on which he used to sit, smiling or serious, 
                        <lb n="51598"/>asking himself why he had come, displeased with her and with 
                        <lb n="51599"/>himself, confounded by the print of the Sacred Heart above the 
                        <lb n="51600"/>untenanted sideboard. He saw her approach him in a lull of the 
                        <lb n="51601"/>talk and beg him to sing one of his curious songs. Then he saw 
                        <lb n="51602"/>himself sitting at the old piano, striking chords softly from its 
                        <lb n="51603"/>speckled keys and singing, amid the talk which had risen again 
                        <lb n="51604"/>in the room, to her who leaned beside the mantelpiece a dainty 
                        <lb n="51605"/>song of the Elizabethans, a sad and sweet loth to depart, the 
                        <lb n="51606"/>victory chant of Agincourt, the happy air of Greensleeves. 
                        <lb n="51607"/>While he sang and she listened, or feigned to listen, his heart 
                        <lb n="51608"/>was at rest but when the quaint old songs had ended and he 
                        <lb n="51609"/>heard again the voices in the room he remembered his own 
                        <lb n="51610"/>sarcasm: the house where young men are called by their chris- 
                        <lb n="51611"/>tian names a little too soon. </p>
                    <lb n="51612"/><p> At certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but he 
                        <lb n="51613"/>had waited in vain. She passed now dancing lightly across his 
                        <lb n="51614"/>memory as she had been that night at the carnival ball. Her 
                        <lb n="51615"/>white dress a little lifted, a white spray nodding in her hair. She 
                        <lb n="51616"/>danced lightly in the round. She was dancing towards him and, 
                        <lb n="51617"/>as she came, her eyes were a little averted and a faint glow was 
                        <lb n="51618"/>on her cheek. At the pause in the chain of hands her hand had 
                        <lb n="51619"/>lain in his an instant, a soft merchandise. 
                        <lb n="51620"/><said who="???">―You are a great stranger now. </said>
                        <lb n="51621"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Yes. I was born to be a monk. </said>
                        <lb n="51622"/><said who="???">―I am afraid you are a heretic. </said>
                        <lb n="51623"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Are you much afraid?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="51624"/><p> For answer she had danced away from him along the chain 
                        <lb n="51625"/>of hands, dancing lightly and discreetly, giving herself to none. 
                        <lb n="51626"/>The white spray nodded to her dancing and when she was in 
                        <lb n="51627"/>shadow the glow was deeper on her cheek. </p>
                    <lb n="51628"/><p> A monk! His own image started forth a profaner of the 
                        <lb n="51629"/>cloister, a heretic franciscan, willing and willing not to serve, 
                        <lb n="51630"/>spinning like Gherardino da Borgo San Donnino a lithe web of 
                        <lb n="51631"/>sophistry and whispering in her ear. </p>
                    <lb n="51632"/><p> No, it was not his image. It was the image of the young 
                        <lb n="51633"/>priest in whose company he had seen her last, looking at him 
                        <lb n="51634"/>out of dove's eyes, toying with the pages of her Irish phrase- 
                        <lb n="51635"/>book. 
                        <lb n="51636"/><said who="???">―Yes, yes, the ladies are coming round to us. I can see it every 
                            <lb n="51637"/>day. The ladies are with us. The best helpers the language has. </said>
                        <lb n="51638"/><said who="???">―And the church, Father Moran? </said>
                        <lb n="51639"/><said who="???">―The church too. Coming round too. The work is going 
                            <lb n="51640"/>ahead there too. Don't fret about the church.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="51641"/><p> Bah! he had done well to leave the room in disdain. He had 
                        <lb n="51642"/>done well not to salute her on the steps of the library. He had 
                        <lb n="51643"/>done well to leave her to flirt with her priest, to toy with a 
                        <lb n="51644"/>church which was the scullerymaid of christendom. </p>
                    <lb n="51645"/><p> Rude brutal anger routed the last lingering instant of ecstasy 
                        <lb n="51646"/>from his soul. It broke up violently her fair image and flung the 
                        <lb n="51647"/>fragments on all sides. On all sides distorted reflections of her 
                        <lb n="51648"/>image started from his memory: the flowergirl in the ragged 
                        <lb n="51649"/>dress with damp coarse hair and a hoyden's face who had 
                        <lb n="51650"/>called herself his own girl and begged his handsel, the kitchen- 
                        <lb n="51651"/>girl in the next house who sang over the clatter of her plates

                            <lb n="51653"/>Killarney's Lakes and Fells</emph>, a girl who had laughed gaily to see 
                        <lb n="51654"/>him stumble when the iron grating in the footpath near <place><location><geo>53.343835 -6.267562</geo></location><placeName>Cork 
                                <lb n="51655"/>Hill</placeName></place> had caught the broken sole of his shoe, a girl he had 
                        <lb n="51656"/>glanced at, attracted by her small ripe mouth as she passed out 
                        <lb n="51657"/>of Jacob's biscuit factory, who had cried to him over her shoul- 
                        <lb n="51658"/>der: 
                        <lb n="51659"/><said who="???">―Do you like what you seen of me, straight hair and curly

                    <lb n="51661"/><p> And yet he felt that, however he might revile and mock her 
                        <lb n="51662"/>image, his anger was also a form of homage. He had left the 
                        <lb n="51663"/>classroom in disdain that was not wholly sincere, feeling that 
                        <lb n="51664"/>perhaps the secret of her race lay behind those dark eyes upon 
                        <lb n="51665"/>which her long lashes flung a quick shadow. He had told him- 
                        <lb n="51666"/>self bitterly as he walked through the streets that she was a 
                        <lb n="51667"/>figure of the womanhood of her country, a batlike soul waking 
                        <lb n="51668"/>to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and lone- 
                        <lb n="51669"/>liness, tarrying a while, loveless and sinless, with her mild lover 
                        <lb n="51670"/>and leaving him to whisper of innocent transgressions in the 
                        <lb n="51671"/>latticed ear of a priest. His anger against her found vent in 
                        <lb n="51672"/>coarse railing at her paramour, whose name and voice and 
                        <lb n="51673"/>features offended his baffled pride: a priested peasant, with a 
                        <lb n="51674"/>brother a policeman in Dublin and a brother a potboy in <place><location><geo>53.338748 -9.181478</geo></location>

                    <lb n="51689"/><p> He spoke the verses aloud from the first lines till the music 
                        <lb n="51690"/>and rhythm suffused his mind, turning it to quiet indulgence; 
                        <lb n="51691"/>then copied them painfully to feel them the better by seeing 
                        <lb n="51692"/>them; then lay back on his bolster. </p>
                    <lb n="51693"/><p> The full morning light had come. No sound was to be heard: 
                        <lb n="51694"/>but he knew that all around him life was about to awaken in 
                        <lb n="51695"/>common noises, hoarse voices, sleepy prayers. Shrinking from 
                        <lb n="51696"/>that life he turned towards the wall, making a cowl of the 
                        <lb n="51697"/>blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet flowers of 
                        <lb n="51698"/>the tattered wallpaper. He tried to warm his perishing joy in 
                        <lb n="51699"/>their scarlet glow, imagining a roseway from where he lay 
                        <lb n="51700"/>upwards to heaven all strewn  with scarlet flowers. Weary! 
                        <lb n="51701"/>Weary! He too was weary of ardent ways. </p>
                    <lb n="51702"/><p> A gradual warmth, a languorous weariness passed over him 
                        <lb n="51703"/>descending along his spine from his closely cowled  head. He 
                        <lb n="51704"/>felt it descend and, seeing himself as he lay, smiled. Soon he 
                        <lb n="51705"/>would sleep. </p>
                    <lb n="51706"/><p> He had written verses for her again after ten years. Ten years 
                        <lb n="51707"/>before she had worn her shawl cowlwise about her head, send- 
                        <lb n="51708"/>ing sprays of her warm breath into the night air, tapping her 
                        <lb n="51709"/>foot upon the glassy road. It was the last tram; the lank brown 
                        <lb n="51710"/>horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night in 
                        <lb n="51711"/>admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both nod- 
                        <lb n="51712"/>ding often in the green light of the lamp. They stood on the 
                        <lb n="51713"/>steps of the tram, he on the upper, she on the lower. She came 
                        <lb n="51714"/>up to his step many times between their phrases and went 
                        <lb n="51715"/>down again and once or twice remained beside him forgetting 
                        <lb n="51716"/>to go down and then went down. Let be! Let be! </p>
                    <lb n="51717"/><p> Ten years from that wisdom of children to his folly. If he 
                        <lb n="51718"/>sent her the verses? They would be read out at breakfast amid 
                        <lb n="51719"/>the tapping of eggshells. Folly indeed! The brothers would 
                        <lb n="51720"/>laugh and try to wrest the page from each other with their 
                        <lb n="51721"/>strong hard fingers. The suave priest, her uncle, seated in his 
                        <lb n="51722"/>armchair, would hold the page at arm's length, read it smiling 
                        <lb n="51723"/>and approve of the literary form. </p>
                    <lb n="51724"/><p> No, no: that was folly. Even if he sent her the verses she 
                        <lb n="51725"/>would not show them to others. No, no: she could not. </p>
                    <lb n="51726"/><p> He began to feel that he had wronged her. A sense of her 
                        <lb n="51727"/>innocence moved him almost to pity her, an innocence he had 
                        <lb n="51728"/>never understood till he had come to the knowledge of it 
                        <lb n="51729"/>through sin, an innocence which she too had not understood 
                        <lb n="51730"/>while she was innocent or before the strange humiliation of her 
                        <lb n="51731"/>nature had first come upon her. Then first her soul had begun 
                        <lb n="51732"/>to live as his soul had when he had first sinned: and a tender 
                        <lb n="51733"/>compassion filled his heart as he remembered her frail pallor 
                        <lb n="51734"/>and her eyes, humbled and saddened by the dark shame of 
                        <lb n="51735"/>womanhood. </p>
                    <lb n="51736"/><p> While his soul had passed from ecstasy to languor where had 
                        <lb n="51737"/>she been? Might it be, in the mysterious ways of spiritual life, 
                        <lb n="51738"/>that her soul at those same moments had been conscious of his 
                        <lb n="51739"/>homage? It might be. </p>
                    <lb n="51740"/><p> A glow of desire kindled again his soul and fired and ful- 
                        <lb n="51741"/>filled all his body. Conscious of his desire she was waking from 
                        <lb n="51742"/>odorous sleep, the temptress of his villanelle. Her eyes, dark 
                        <lb n="51743"/>and with a look of languor, were opening to his eyes. Her 
                        <lb n="51744"/>nakedness yielded to him, radiant, warm, odorous and lavish- 
                        <lb n="51745"/>limbed, enfolded him like a shining cloud, enfolded him like 
                        <lb n="51746"/>water with a liquid life: and like a cloud of vapour or like 
                        <lb n="51747"/>waters circumfluent in space the liquid letters of speech, sym- 
                        <lb n="51748"/>bols of the element of mystery, flowed forth over his brain. </p>

                    <lb n="51769"/><p>He stood on the steps of the library to look at them, leaning 
                        <lb n="51770"/>wearily on his ashplant. They flew round and round the jutting 
                        <lb n="51771"/>shoulder of a house in <place><location><geo>53.340809 -6.257636</geo></location><placeName>Molesworth</placeName></place> Street. The air of the late 
                        <lb n="51772"/>March evening made clear their flight, their dark darting 
                        <lb n="51773"/>quivering bodies flying clearly against the sky as against a 
                        <lb n="51774"/>limphung cloth of smoky tenuous blue. </p>
                    <lb n="51775"/><p> He watched their flight: bird after bird: a dark flash, a 
                        <lb n="51776"/>swerve, a flash again, a dart aside, a curve, a flutter of wings. 
                        <lb n="51777"/>He tried to count them before all their darting quivering bodies 
                        <lb n="51778"/>passed: six, ten, eleven: and wondered were they odd or even in 
                        <lb n="51779"/>number. Twelve, thirteen: for two came wheeling down from 
                        <lb n="51780"/>the upper sky. They were flying high and low but ever round 
                        <lb n="51781"/>and round in straight and curving lines and ever flying from left 
                        <lb n="51782"/>to right, circling about a temple of air. </p>
                    <lb n="51783"/><p> He  listened to their cries: like the squeak of mice behind the 
                        <lb n="51784"/>wainscot: a shrill twofold note. But the notes were long and 
                        <lb n="51785"/>shrill and whirring, unlike the cry of vermin, falling a third or a 
                        <lb n="51786"/>fourth and trilled as the flying beaks clove the air. Their cry 
                        <lb n="51787"/>was shrill and clear and fine and falling like threads of silken 
                        <lb n="51788"/>light unwound from whirring spools. </p>
                    <lb n="51789"/><p> The inhuman clamour soothed his ears in which his 
                        <lb n="51790"/>mother's sobs and reproaches murmured insistently and the 
                        <lb n="51791"/>dark frail quivering bodies wheeling and fluttering and swerv- 
                        <lb n="51792"/>ing round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothed his eyes 
                        <lb n="51793"/>which still saw the image of his mother's face. </p>
                    <lb n="51794"/><p> Why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch, 
                        <lb n="51795"/>hearing their shrill twofold cry, watching their flight? For an 
                        <lb n="51796"/>augury of good or evil? A phrase of Cornelius Agrippa flew 
                        <lb n="51797"/>through his mind and then there flew hither and thither shape- 
                        <lb n="51798"/>less thoughts from Swedenborg on the correspondence of birds 
                        <lb n="51799"/>to things of the intellect and of how the creatures of the air 
                        <lb n="51800"/>have their knowledge and know their times and seasons be- 
                        <lb n="51801"/>cause they, unlike man, are in the order of their life and have 
                        <lb n="51802"/>not perverted that order by reason. </p>
                    <lb n="51803"/><p> And for ages men had gazed upward as he was gazing at 
                        <lb n="51804"/>birds in flight. The colonnade above him made him think 
                        <lb n="51805"/>vaguely of an ancient temple and the ashplant on which he 
                        <lb n="51806"/>leaned wearily of the curved stick of an augur. A sense of fear 
                        <lb n="51807"/>of the unknown moved in the heart of his weariness, a fear of 
                        <lb n="51808"/>symbols and portents, of the hawklike man whose name he 
                        <lb n="51809"/>bore soaring out of his captivity on osierwoven wings, of 
                        <lb n="51810"/>Thoth, the god of writers, writing with a reed upon a tablet 
                        <lb n="51811"/>and bearing on his narrow ibis head the cusped moon. </p>
                    <lb n="51812"/><p> He smiled as he thought of the god's image for it made him 
                        <lb n="51813"/>think of a bottlenosed judge in a wig, putting commas into a 
                        <lb n="51814"/>document which he held at arm's length and he knew that he 
                        <lb n="51815"/>would not have remembered the god's name but that it was like 
                        <lb n="51816"/>an Irish oath. It was folly. But was it for this folly that he was 
                        <lb n="51817"/>about to leave for ever the house of prayer and prudence into 
                        <lb n="51818"/>which he had been born and the order of life out of which he 
                        <lb n="51819"/>had come? </p>
                    <lb n="51820"/><p> They came back with shrill cries over the jutting shoulder of 
                        <lb n="51821"/>the house, flying darkly against the fading air. What birds were 
                        <lb n="51822"/>they? He thought that they must be swallows who had come 
                        <lb n="51823"/>back from the south. Then he was to go away? for they were 
                        <lb n="51824"/>birds ever going and coming, building ever an unlasting home 
                        <lb n="51825"/>under the eaves of men's houses and ever leaving the homes 
                        <lb n="51826"/>they had built to wander. </p>

                        <lb n="51829"/><l>Upon the nest under the eave before</l>

                    <lb n="51831"/><p> A soft liquid joy like the noise of many waters flowed over 
                        <lb n="51832"/>his memory and he felt in his heart the soft peace of silent 
                        <lb n="51833"/>spaces of fading tenuous sky above the waters, of oceanic si- 
                        <lb n="51834"/>lence, of swallows flying through the seadusk over the flowing 
                        <lb n="51835"/>waters. </p>
                    <lb n="51836"/><p> A soft liquid joy flowed through the words where the soft

                        <lb n="51839"/>mute chime and mute peal and soft low swooning cry: and he 
                        <lb n="51840"/>felt that the augury he had sought in the wheeling darting birds 
                        <lb n="51841"/>and in the pale space of sky above him had come forth from his 
                        <lb n="51842"/>heart like a bird from a turret quietly and swiftly. </p>

                        <lb n="51847"/>looking out of jaded eyes at the culture of Dublin in the stalls 
                        <lb n="51848"/>and at the tawdry scenecloths and human dolls framed by the 
                        <lb n="51849"/>garish lamps of the stage. A burly policeman sweated behind 
                        <lb n="51850"/>him and seemed at every moment about to act. The catcalls 
                        <lb n="51851"/>and hisses and mocking cries ran in rude gusts round the hall 
                        <lb n="51852"/>from his scattered fellowstudents.

                        <lb n="51863"/>went up the staircase and passed in through the clicking turn-

                    <lb n="51865"/><p> Cranly was sitting over near the dictionaries. A thick book, 
                        <lb n="51866"/>opened at the frontispiece, lay before him on the wooden rest. 
                        <lb n="51867"/>He leaned back in his chair, inclining his ear like that of a 
                        <lb n="51868"/>confessor to the face of the medical student who was reading to 
                        <lb n="51869"/>him a problem from the chess page of a journal. Stephen sat 
                        <lb n="51870"/>down at his right and the priest at the other side of the  table 
                        <lb n="51871"/>closed his copy of <emph>The Tablet</emph> with an angry snap and stood up. </p>
                    <lb n="51872"/><p> Cranly gazed after him blandly and vaguely. The medical

                    <lb n="51877"/><p> Dixon folded the journal and rose with dignity, saying: 
                        <lb n="51878"/><said who="???">―Our men retired in good order. </said>
                        <lb n="51879"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―With guns and cattle, added Stephen, pointing to the title-

                    <lb n="51884"/><p> Cranly did not answer or turn. He laid his book on the 
                        <lb n="51885"/>counter and passed out, his wellshod feet sounding flatly on the 
                        <lb n="51886"/>floor. On the staircase he paused and gazing absently at Dixon 
                        <lb n="51887"/>repeated:

                    <lb n="51890"/><p> He had a quiet toneless voice and urbane manners and on a 
                        <lb n="51891"/>finger of his plump clean hand he displayed at moments a 
                        <lb n="51892"/>signet ring. </p>
                    <lb n="51893"/><p> As they crossed the hall a man of dwarfish stature came 
                        <lb n="51894"/>towards them. Under the dome of his tiny hat his unshaven 
                        <lb n="51895"/>face began to smile with pleasure and he was heard to murmur. 
                        <lb n="51896"/>The eyes were melancholy as those of a monkey.

                    <lb n="51902"/><p> Dixon smiled and turned his ring. The blackish monkey- 
                        <lb n="51903"/>puckered face pursed its human mouth with gentle pleasure 
                        <lb n="51904"/>and its voice purred:

                    <lb n="51908"/><p> Cranly smiled and said kindly:

                    <lb n="51915"/><p> He moved a thin shrunken brown hand gently in the air in 
                        <lb n="51916"/>time to his praise and his thin quick eyelids beat often over his 
                        <lb n="51917"/>sad eyes. </p>
                    <lb n="51918"/><p> Sadder to Stephen's ear was his speech: a genteel accent, low 
                        <lb n="51919"/>and moist, marred by errors: and listening to it he wondered 
                        <lb n="51920"/>was the story true and was the thin blood that flowed in his 
                        <lb n="51921"/>shrunken frame noble and come of an incestuous  love? </p>
                    <lb n="51922"/><p> The park trees were heavy with rain and rain fell still and 
                        <lb n="51923"/>ever in the lake, lying grey like a shield. A game of swans flew 
                        <lb n="51924"/>there and the water and the shore beneath were fouled with 
                        <lb n="51925"/>their greenwhite slime. They embraced softly impelled by the 
                        <lb n="51926"/>grey rainy light, the wet silent trees, the shieldlike witnessing 
                        <lb n="51927"/>lake, the swans. They embraced without joy or passion, his 
                        <lb n="51928"/>arm about his sister's neck. A grey woollen cloak was wrapped 
                        <lb n="51929"/>athwart her from her shoulder to her waist: and her fair head was 
                        <lb n="51930"/>bent in willing shame. He had loose redbrown hair and tender 
                        <lb n="51931"/>shapely strong freckled hands. Face? There was no face seen. 
                        <lb n="51932"/>The brother's face was bent upon her fair rainfragrant hair. 
                        <lb n="51933"/>The hand freckled and strong and shapely and caressing was 
                        <lb n="51934"/>Davin's hand. </p>
                    <lb n="51935"/><p> He frowned angrily upon his thought and on the shrivelled 
                        <lb n="51936"/>mannikin who had called it forth. His father's gibes at the <place><location><geo>51.680080 -9.452576</geo></location> 
                            <lb n="51937"/><placeName>Bantry</placeName></place> gang leaped out of his memory. He held them at a 
                        <lb n="51938"/>distance and brooded uneasily on his own thought again. Why 
                        <lb n="51939"/>were they not  Cranly's hands? Had Davin's simplicity and in- 
                        <lb n="51940"/>nocence stung him more secretly? </p>
                    <lb n="51941"/><p> He walked on across the hall with Dixon, leaving Cranly to 
                        <lb n="51942"/>take leave elaborately of the dwarf. </p>
                    <lb n="51943"/><p> Under the colonnade Temple was standing in the midst of a 
                        <lb n="51944"/>little group of students. One of them cried: 
                        <lb n="51945"/><said who="???">―Dixon, come over till you hear. Temple is in grand form.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="51946"/><p> Temple turned on him his dark gipsy eyes. 
                        <lb n="51947"/><said who="???">―You're a hypocrite, O'Keeffe,</said> he said. <said who="???">And Dixon's a smiler. 
                            <lb n="51948"/>By hell, I think that's a good literary expression.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="51949"/><p> He laughed slily, looking in Stephen's face, repeating: 
                        <lb n="51950"/><said who="???">―By hell, I'm delighted with that name. A smiler.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="51951"/><p> A stout student who stood below them on the steps said:

                            <lb n="51953"/>that. </said>
                        <said who="Temple">―He had, faith,</said> Temple said. <said who="Temple">And he was a married man too. <lb n="51954"></lb>

                    <lb n="51962"/><p> He moved with a shambling gait round the group and spoke

                    <lb n="51966"/><p> Cranly came out through the door of the entrance hall, his 
                        <lb n="51967"/>hat thrust back on the nape of his neck and picking his teeth 
                        <lb n="51968"/>with care.

                    <lb n="51971"/><p> He paused for an answer. Cranly dislodged a figseed from

                        <lb n="51973"/>intently.

                        <lb n="51996"/><said who="Goggins">―I had it on my mind to say that,</said> Goggins answered firmly. <said who="Goggins">It 
                            <lb n="51997"/>did no-one any harm, did it? </said>

                        <lb n="52000"/><said who="Temple">―Didn't I tell you he was a smiler?</said> said Temple, turning right 
                        <lb n="52001"/>and left. <said who="Temple">Didn't I give him that name? </said>
                        <lb n="52002"/><said who="???">―You did. We're not deaf,</said> said the tall consumptive. </p>
                    <lb n="52003"/><p> Cranly still frowned at the stout student below him. Then, 
                        <lb n="52004"/>with a snort of disgust, he shoved him violently down the steps. 
                        <lb n="52005"/><said who="Cranly">―Go away from here,</said> he said rudely. <said who="Cranly">Go away, you stinkpot.

                    <lb n="52007"/><p> Goggins skipped down on to the gravel and at once returned 
                        <lb n="52008"/>to his place with good humour. Temple turned back to Stephen 
                        <lb n="52009"/>and asked: 
                        <lb n="52010"/><said who="Temple">―Do you believe in the law of heredity? </said>
                        <lb n="52011"/><said who="Cranly">―Are you drunk or what are you or what are you trying to 
                            <lb n="52012"/>say?</said> asked Cranly, facing round on him with an expression of 
                        <lb n="52013"/>wonder.
                        <lb n="52014"/><said who="Temple">―The most profound sentence ever written,</said> Temple said with 
                        <lb n="52015"/>enthusiasm, <said who="Temple">is the sentence at the end of the zoology. Repro- 
                            <lb n="52016"/>duction is the beginning of death.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52017"/><p> He touched Stephen timidly at the elbow and said eagerly: 
                        <lb n="52018"/><said who="???">―Do you feel how profound that is because you are a poet?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52019"/><p> Cranly pointed his long forefinger. 
                        <lb n="52020"/><said who="???">―Look at him! he said with scorn to the others. Look at

                    <lb n="52022"/><p> They laughed at his words and gesture. Temple turned on 
                        <lb n="52023"/>him bravely, saying: 
                        <lb n="52024"/><said who="Temple">―Cranly, you're always sneering at me. I can see that. But I

                            <lb n="52026"/>about you now as compared with myself? </said>
                        <lb n="52027"/><said who="Cranly">―My dear man,</said> said Cranly urbanely, <said who="Cranly">you are incapable, do

                        <lb n="52029"/><said who="Temple">―But do you know,</said> Temple went on, <said who="Temple">what I think of you and

                        <lb n="52031"/><said who="a student">―Out with it, Temple!</said> the stout student cried from the steps. 
                        <lb n="52032"/><said who="a student">Get it out in bits!</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52033"/><p> Temple turned right and left, making sudden feeble gestures 
                        <lb n="52034"/>as he spoke. 
                        <lb n="52035"/><said who="Temple">―I'm a ballocks,</said> he said, shaking his head in despair. <said who="???">I am. 
                            <lb n="52036"/>And I know I am. And I admit it that I am.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52037"/><p> Dixon patted him lightly on the shoulder and said mildly: 
                        <lb n="52038"/><said who="Dixon">―And it does you every credit, Temple. </said>
                        <lb n="52039"/><said who="Temple">―But he,</said> Temple said, pointing to Cranly. <said who="???">He is a ballocks too 
                            <lb n="52040"/>like me. Only he doesn't know it. And that's the only difference 
                            <lb n="52041"/>I see.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52042"/><p> A burst of laughter covered his words. But he turned again 
                        <lb n="52043"/>to Stephen and said with a sudden eagerness: 
                        <lb n="52044"/><said who="Temple">―That word is a most interesting word. That's the only Eng- 
                            <lb n="52045"/>lish dual number. Did you know? </said>
                        <lb n="52046"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Is it?</said> Stephen said vaguely. </p>
                    <lb n="52047"/><p> He was watching Cranly's firmfeatured suffering face, lit up 
                        <lb n="52048"/>now by a smile of false patience. The gross name had passed 
                        <lb n="52049"/>over it like foul water poured over an old stone image, patient 
                        <lb n="52050"/>of injuries: and, as he watched him, he saw him raise his hat in 
                        <lb n="52051"/>salute and uncover the black hair that stood up stiffly from his 
                        <lb n="52052"/>forehead like an iron crown. </p>
                    <lb n="52053"/><p> She passed out from the porch of the library and bowed 
                        <lb n="52054"/>across Stephen in reply to Cranly's greeting. He also? Was there 
                        <lb n="52055"/>not a slight flush on Cranly's cheek? Or had it come forth at 
                        <lb n="52056"/>Temple's words? The light had waned. He could not see. </p>
                    <lb n="52057"/><p> Did that explain his friend's listless silence, his harsh com- 
                        <lb n="52058"/>ments, the sudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had 
                        <lb n="52059"/>shattered so often Stephen's ardent wayward confessions? Ste- 
                        <lb n="52060"/>phen had forgiven freely for he had found this rudeness also in 
                        <lb n="52061"/>himself towards himself. And he remembered an evening when 
                        <lb n="52062"/>he had dismounted from a borrowed creaking bicycle to pray 
                        <lb n="52063"/>to God in a wood near <place><location><geo>53.450924 -6.150138</geo></location><placeName>Malahide</placeName></place>. He had lifted up his arms 
                        <lb n="52064"/>and spoken in ecstasy to the sombre nave of the trees, knowing 
                        <lb n="52065"/>that he stood on holy ground and in a holy hour. And when 
                        <lb n="52066"/>two constabularymen had come into sight round a bend in the 
                        <lb n="52067"/>gloomy road he had broken off his prayer to whistle loudly an 
                        <lb n="52068"/>air from the last pantomime. </p>
                    <lb n="52069"/><p> He began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the 
                        <lb n="52070"/>base of a pillar. Had Cranly not heard him? Yet he could wait. 
                        <lb n="52071"/>The talk about him ceased for a moment: and a soft hiss fell 
                        <lb n="52072"/>again from a window above. But no other sound was in the air 
                        <lb n="52073"/>and the swallows whose flight he had followed with idle eyes 
                        <lb n="52074"/>were sleeping. </p>
                    <lb n="52075"/><p> She had passed through the dusk. And therefore the air was 
                        <lb n="52076"/>silent save for one soft hiss that fell. And therefore the tongues 
                        <lb n="52077"/>about him had ceased their babble. Darkness  was falling. </p>
                    <lb n="52078"/><p> <l><emph>Darkness falls from the air.</emph></l> </p>
                    <lb n="52079"/><p> A trembling joy, lambent as a faint light, played like a fairy 
                        <lb n="52080"/>host around him. But why? Her passage through the darkening 
                        <lb n="52081"/>air or the verse with its black vowels and its opening sound, 
                        <lb n="52082"/>rich and lutelike? </p>
                    <lb n="52083"/><p> He walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the 
                        <lb n="52084"/>end of the colonnade, beating the stone softly with his stick to 
                        <lb n="52085"/>hide his revery from the students whom he had left: and 
                        <lb n="52086"/>allowed his mind to summon back to itself the age of Dowland 
                        <lb n="52087"/>and Byrd and Nash. </p>
                    <lb n="52088"/><p> Eyes, opening from the darkness of desire, eyes that dimmed 
                        <lb n="52089"/>the breaking east. What was their languid grace but the soft- 
                        <lb n="52090"/>ness of chambering? And what was their shimmer but the 
                        <lb n="52091"/>shimmer of the scum that mantled the cesspool of the court of a 
                        <lb n="52092"/>slobbering Stuart. And he tasted in the language of memory 
                        <lb n="52093"/>ambered wines, dying fallings of sweet airs, the proud pavan: 
                        <lb n="52094"/>and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in <place><location><geo>51.511732 -0.123270</geo></location><placeName>Covent 
                                <lb n="52095"/>Garden</placeName></place> wooing from their balconies with sucking mouths and 
                        <lb n="52096"/>the poxfouled wenches of the taverns and young wives that, 
                        <lb n="52097"/>gaily yielding to their ravishers, clipped and clipped again. </p>
                    <lb n="52098"/><p> The images he had summoned gave him no pleasure. They 
                        <lb n="52099"/>were secret and enflaming but her image was not entangled by 
                        <lb n="52100"/>them. That was not the way to think of her. It was not even the 
                        <lb n="52101"/>way in which he thought of her. Could his mind then not trust 
                        <lb n="52102"/>itself? Old phrases, sweet only with a disinterred sweetness like 
                        <lb n="52103"/>the figseeds Cranly rooted out of his gleaming teeth. </p>
                    <lb n="52104"/><p> It was not thought nor vision though he knew vaguely that 
                        <lb n="52105"/>her figure was passing homeward through the city. Vaguely 
                        <lb n="52106"/>first and then more sharply he smelt her body. A conscious 
                        <lb n="52107"/>unrest seethed in his blood. Yes, it was her body that he smelt: 
                        <lb n="52108"/>a wild and languid smell: the tepid limbs over which his music 
                        <lb n="52109"/>had flowed desirously and the secret soft linen upon which her 
                        <lb n="52110"/>flesh distilled odour and a dew. </p>
                    <lb n="52111"/><p> A louse crawled over the nape of his neck and, putting his 
                        <lb n="52112"/>thumb and forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar, he caught 
                        <lb n="52113"/>it. He rolled its body, tender yet brittle as a grain of rice, be- 
                        <lb n="52114"/>tween thumb and finger for an instant before he let it fall from 
                        <lb n="52115"/>him and wondered would it live or die. There came to his mind 
                        <lb n="52116"/>a curious phrase from Cornelius a Lapide which said that the 
                        <lb n="52117"/>lice born of human sweat were not created by God with the 
                        <lb n="52118"/>other animals on the sixth day. But the tickling of the skin of 
                        <lb n="52119"/>his neck made his mind raw and red. The life of his body, 
                        <lb n="52120"/>illclad, illfed, louseeaten, made him close his eyelids in a sud- 
                        <lb n="52121"/>den spasm of despair: and in the darkness he saw the brittle 
                        <lb n="52122"/>bright bodies of lice falling from the air and turning often as 
                        <lb n="52123"/>they fell. Yes: and it was not darkness that fell from the air. It 
                        <lb n="52124"/>was brightness. </p>
                    <lb n="52125"/><p> <l><emph>Brightness falls from the air.</emph></l> </p>
                    <lb n="52126"/><p> He had not even remembered rightly Nash's line. All the 
                        <lb n="52127"/>images it  had awakened were false. His mind bred vermin. His 
                        <lb n="52128"/>thoughts were lice born of the sweat of sloth. </p>
                    <lb n="52129"/><p> He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the 
                        <lb n="52130"/>group of students. Well then let her go and be damned to her. 
                        <lb n="52131"/>She could love some clean athlete who washed himself every 
                        <lb n="52132"/>morning to the waist and had black hair on his chest. Let her. </p>
                    <lb n="52133"/><p> Cranly had taken another dried fig from the supply in his 
                        <lb n="52134"/>pocket and was eating it slowly and noisily. Temple sat on the 
                        <lb n="52135"/>pediment of a pillar, leaning back, his cap pulled down on his 
                        <lb n="52136"/>sleepy eyes. A squat young man came out of the porch, a 
                        <lb n="52137"/>leather portfolio tucked under his armpit. He marched towards 
                        <lb n="52138"/>the group, striking the flags with the heels of his boots and 
                        <lb n="52139"/>with the ferrule of his heavy umbrella. Then, raising the um- 
                        <lb n="52140"/>brella in salute, he said to all: 
                        <lb n="52141"/><said who="???">―Good evening, sirs.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52142"/><p> He struck the flags again and tittered while his head 
                        <lb n="52143"/>trembled with a slight nervous movement. The tall consump- 
                        <lb n="52144"/>tive student and Dixon and O'Keeffe were speaking in Irish and 
                        <lb n="52145"/>did not answer him. Then, turning to Cranly, he said: 
                        <lb n="52146"/><said who="???">―Good evening, particularly to you.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52147"/><p> He moved the umbrella in indication and tittered again. 
                        <lb n="52148"/>Cranly, who was still chewing the fig, answered with loud 
                        <lb n="52149"/>movements of his jaws. 
                        <lb n="52150"/><said who="???">―Good? Yes. It is a good evening.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52151"/><p> The squat student looked at him seriously and shook his 
                        <lb n="52152"/>umbrella gently and reprovingly. 
                        <lb n="52153"/><said who="???">―I can see, he said, that you are about to make obvious 
                            <lb n="52154"/>remarks. </said>
                        <lb n="52155"/><said who="???">―Um, Cranly answered, holding out what remained of the 
                            <lb n="52156"/>halfchewed fig and jerking it towards the squat student's 
                            <lb n="52157"/>mouth in sign that he should eat.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52158"/><p> The squat student did not eat it but, indulging his  special 
                        <lb n="52159"/>humour, said gravely, still tittering and prodding his phrase 
                        <lb n="52160"/>with his  umbrella: 
                        <lb n="52161"/><said who="???">―Do you intend that ...</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52162"/><p> He broke off, pointed bluntly to the munched pulp of the fig 
                        <lb n="52163"/>and said loudly: 
                        <lb n="52164"/><said who="???">―I allude to that. </said>
                        <lb n="52165"/><said who="Cranly">―Um, Cranly said as before. </said>
                        <lb n="52166"/><said who="???">―Do you intend that now, the squat student said, as <emph>ipso facto</emph> 
                            <lb n="52167"/>or, let us say, as so to speak?</said></p>
                    <lb n="52168"/><p> Dixon turned aside from his group, saying: 
                        <lb n="52169"/><said who="???">―Goggins was waiting for you, Glynn. He has gone round to 
                            <lb n="52170"/>the Adelphi to look for you and Moynihan. What have you 
                            <lb n="52171"/>there? he asked, tapping the portfolio under Glynn's arm. </said></p>
                    <lb n="52172"/><p> <said who="???">―Examination papers, Glynn answered. I give them monthly 
                            <lb n="52173"/>examinations to see that they are profiting by my tuition.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52174"/><p> He also tapped the portfolio and coughed gently and smiled. 
                        <lb n="52175"/><said who="Cranly">―Tuition! said Cranly rudely. I suppose you mean the bare- 
                            <lb n="52176"/>footed children that are taught by a bloody ape like you. God 
                            <lb n="52177"/>help them!</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52178"/><p> He bit off the rest of the fig and flung away the butt. 
                        <lb n="52179"/><said who="???">―I suffer little children to come unto me, Glynn said amiably. </said>
                        <lb n="52180"/><said who="???">―A bloody ape, Cranly repeated with emphasis, and a blas- 
                            <lb n="52181"/>phemous bloody ape!</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52182"/><p> Temple stood up and, pushing past Cranly, addressed 
                        <lb n="52183"/>Glynn: 
                        <lb n="52184"/><said who="???">―That phrase you said now,</said> he said, <said who="???">is from the new testa- 
                            <lb n="52185"/>ment about suffer the children to come to me. </said>
                        <lb n="52186"/><said who="???">―Go to sleep again, Temple, said O'Keeffe. </said>
                        <lb n="52187"/><said who="???">―Very well, then, Temple continued, still addressing Glynn, 
                            <lb n="52188"/>and if Jesus suffered the children to come why does the church 
                            <lb n="52189"/>send them all to hell if they die unbaptised? Why is that? </said>
                        <lb n="52190"/><said who="???">―Were you baptised yourself, Temple? the consumptive stu- 
                            <lb n="52191"/>dent asked. </said>
                        <lb n="52192"/><said who="???">―But why are they sent to hell if Jesus said they were all to 
                            <lb n="52193"/>come?</said> Temple said, his eyes searching in Glynn's eyes. </p>
                    <lb n="52194"/><p> Glynn coughed and said gently, holding back with difficulty 
                        <lb n="52195"/>the nervous titter in his voice and moving his umbrella at every 
                        <lb n="52196"/>word: </p>
                    <lb n="52197"/><p><said who="Glynn">―And, as you remark, if it is thus I ask emphatically whence 
                            <lb n="52198"/>comes this thusness. </said></p>
                    <lb n="52199"/><said who="Temple">―Because the church is cruel like all old sinners,</said> Temple said.
                    <lb n="52200"/><said who="Dixon">―Are you quite orthodox on that point, Temple?</said> Dixon said 
                    <lb n="52201"/>suavely.
                    <lb n="52202"/><said who="Temple">―Saint Augustine says that about unbaptised children going to 
                        <lb n="52203"/>hell,</said> Temple answered, <said who="Temple">because he was a cruel old sinner too. </said>
                    <lb n="52204"/><said who="Dixon">―I bow to you,</said> Dixon said, <said who="Dixon">but I had the impression that 
                        <lb n="52205"/>limbo existed for such cases. </said>
                    <lb n="52206"/><said who="Cranly">―Don't argue with him, Dixon,</said> Cranly said brutally. <said who="Cranly">Don't 
                        <lb n="52207"/>talk to him or look at him. Lead him home with a sugan the 
                        <lb n="52208"/>way you'd lead a bleating goat. </said>
                    <lb n="52209"/><said who="Temple">―Limbo!</said> Temple cried. <said who="Temple">That's a fine invention too. Like hell. </said>
                    <lb n="52210"/><said who="???">―But with the unpleasantness left out,</said> Dixon said.
                    <lb n="52211"/><p> He turned smiling to the others and said: 
                        <lb n="52212"/><said who="???">―I think I am voicing the opinions of all present in saying so 
                            <lb n="52213"/>much. </said>
                        <lb n="52214"/><said who="Glynn">―You are,</said> Glynn said in a firm tone. <said who="Glynn">On that point Ireland is 
                            <lb n="52215"/>united.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52216"/><p> He struck the ferrule of his umbrella on the stone floor of 
                        <lb n="52217"/>the colonnade. 
                        <lb n="52218"/><said who="Temple">―Hell,</said> Temple said. <said who="Temple">I can respect that invention of the grey 
                            <lb n="52219"/>spouse of Satan. Hell is Roman, like the walls of the Romans, 
                            <lb n="52220"/>strong and ugly. But what is limbo? </said>
                        <lb n="52221"/><said who="???">―Put him back into  the perambulator, Cranly,</said> O'Keeffe called 
                        <lb n="52222"/>out.</p>
                    <lb n="52223"/>Cranly made a swift step towards Temple, halted, stamping 
                    <lb n="52224"/>his foot and crying as if to a fowl: 
                    <lb n="52225"/><said who="Cranly">―Hoosh!</said>
                    <lb n="52226"/>Temple moved away nimbly. 
                    <lb n="52227"/><said who="Temple">―Do you know what limbo is?</said> he cried. <said who="Temple">Do you know what 
                        <lb n="52228"/>we call a notion like that in Roscommon? </said>
                    <lb n="52229"/><said who="Cranly">―Hoosh! Blast you!</said> Cranly cried, clapping his hands.
                    <lb n="52230"/><said who="Temple">―Neither my arse nor my elbow!</said> Temple cried out scornfully. 
                    <lb n="52231"/><said who="Temple">And that's what I call limbo. </said>
                    <lb n="52232"/><said who="Cranly">―Give us that stick here,</said> Cranly said.
                    <lb n="52233"/><p> He snatched the ashplant roughly from Stephen's hand and 
                        <lb n="52234"/>sprang down the steps: but Temple, hearing him move in pur- 
                        <lb n="52235"/>suit, fled through the dusk like a wild creature, nimble and 
                        <lb n="52236"/>fleetfooted. Cranly's heavy boots were heard loudly charging 
                        <lb n="52237"/>across the quadrangle and then returning heavily, foiled and 
                        <lb n="52238"/>spurning the gravel at each step. </p>
                    <lb n="52239"/><p> His step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he 
                        <lb n="52240"/>thrust the stick back into Stephen's hand. Stephen felt that his 
                        <lb n="52241"/>anger had another cause but, feigning patience, touched his 
                        <lb n="52242"/>arm slightly and said quietly: 
                        <lb n="52243"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Cranly, I told you I wanted to speak to you. Come away.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52244"/><p> Cranly looked at him for a few moments and asked: 
                        <lb n="52245"/><said who="Cranly">―Now? </said>
                        <lb n="52246"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Yes, now,</said> Stephen said. <said who="Stephen Dedalus">We can't speak here. Come away.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52247"/><p> They crossed the quadrangle together without speaking. The 
                        <lb n="52248"/>birdcall from <emph>Siegfried</emph> whistled softly followed them from the 
                        <lb n="52249"/>steps of the porch. Cranly turned: and Dixon, who had 
                        <lb n="52250"/>whistled, called out: 
                        <lb n="52251"/><said who="Dixon">―Where are you fellows off to? What about that  game, 
                            <lb n="52252"/>Cranly?</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52253"/><p> They parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of 
                        <lb n="52254"/>billiards to be played in the <place><location><geo>53.350570 -6.254002</geo></location><placeName>Adelphi hotel</placeName></place>. Stephen walked on 
                        <lb n="52255"/>alone and out into the quiet of Kildare Street. Opposite 
                        <lb n="52256"/>Maple's hotel he stood to wait, patient again. The name of the 
                        <lb n="52257"/>hotel, a colourless polished wood, and its colourless quiet front 
                        <lb n="52258"/>stung him like a glance of polite disdain. He stared angrily back 
                        <lb n="52259"/>at the softly lit drawingroom of the hotel in which he imagined 
                        <lb n="52260"/>the sleek lives of the patricians of Ireland housed in calm. They 
                        <lb n="52261"/>thought of army commissions and land agents: peasants greeted 
                        <lb n="52262"/>them along the roads  in the country: they knew the names of 
                        <lb n="52263"/>certain French dishes and gave orders to jarvies in highpitched 
                        <lb n="52264"/>provincial voices which pierced through their skintight accents. </p>
                    <lb n="52265"/><p> How could he hit their conscience or how cast his shadow 
                        <lb n="52266"/>over the imagination of their daughters, before their squires 
                        <lb n="52267"/>begat upon them, that they might breed a race less ignoble than 
                        <lb n="52268"/>their own? And under the deepened dusk he felt the thoughts 
                        <lb n="52269"/>and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting like bats 
                        <lb n="52270"/>across the dark country lanes,  under trees by the edges of 
                        <lb n="52271"/>streams and near the poolmottled bogs. A woman had waited 
                        <lb n="52272"/>in the doorway as Davin had passed by at night and, offering 
                        <lb n="52273"/>him a cup of milk, had all but wooed him to her bed: for Davin 
                        <lb n="52274"/>had the mild eyes of one that could be secret. But him no 
                        <lb n="52275"/>woman's eyes had wooed. </p>
                    <lb n="52276"/><p> His arm was taken in a strong grip and Cranly's voice said: 
                        <lb n="52277"/><said who="Cranly">―Let us eke go.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52278"/><p> They walked southward in silence. Then Cranly said: 
                        <lb n="52279"/><said who="Cranly">―That blithering idiot Temple! I swear to Moses, do you 
                            <lb n="52280"/>know, that I'll be the death of that fellow one time.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52281"/><p> But his voice was no longer angry and Stephen wondered 
                        <lb n="52282"/>was he thinking of her greeting to him under the porch. </p>
                    <lb n="52283"/><p> They turned to the left and walked on as before. When they 
                        <lb n="52284"/>had gone on so for some time Stephen said: 
                        <lb n="52285"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Cranly, I had an unpleasant quarrel this evening. </said>
                        <lb n="52286"/><said who="Cranly">―With your people?</said> Cranly asked.
                        <lb n="52287"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―With my mother. </said>
                        <lb n="52288"/><said who="Cranly">―About religion? </said>
                        <lb n="52289"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Yes, Stephen answered.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52290"/><p> After a pause Cranly asked: 
                        <lb n="52291"/><said who="???">―What age is your mother? </said>
                        <lb n="52292"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―Not old,</said> Stephen said. <said who="Stephen Dedalus">She wishes me to make my easter 
                            <lb n="52293"/>duty. </said>
                        <lb n="52294"/><said who="Cranly">―And will you? </said>
                        <lb n="52295"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I will not,</said> Stephen said.
                        <lb n="52296"/><said who="Cranly">―Why not?</said> Cranly said.
                        <lb n="52297"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I will not serve,</said> answered Stephen.
                        <lb n="52298"/><said who="Cranly">―That remark was made before,</said> Cranly said calmly.
                        <lb n="52299"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―It is made behind now,</said> said Stephen hotly. </p>
                    <lb n="52300"/><p> Cranly pressed Stephen's arm, saying: 
                        <lb n="52301"/><said who="Cranly">―Go easy, my dear man. You're an excitable bloody man, do 
                            <lb n="52302"/>you know.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52303"/><p> He laughed nervously as he spoke and, looking up into Ste- 
                        <lb n="52304"/>phen's face with moved and friendly eyes, said: 
                        <lb n="52305"/><said who="Cranly">―Do you know that you are an excitable man? </said>
                        <lb n="52306"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">―I daresay I am,</said> said Stephen, laughing also. </p>
                    <lb n="52307"/><p> Their minds, lately estranged, seemed suddenly to have been

                            <lb n="52474"/>neediness. Behind a hedge of laurel a light glimmered in the

                            <lb n="52509"/>framed by the dark, and his large dark eyes. Yes. His face was 
                            <lb n="52510"/>handsome: and his body was strong and hard. He had spoken 
                            <lb n="52511"/>of a mother's love. He felt then the sufferings of women, the

                        <lb n="52611"/>me on the score of love for one's mother. Tried to imagine his 
                        <lb n="52612"/>mother: cannot. Told me once, in a moment of thoughtlessness, 
                        <lb n="52613"/>his father was sixtyone when he was born. Can see him. Strong 
                        <lb n="52614"/>farmer type. Pepper and salt suit. Square feet. Unkempt 
                        <lb n="52615"/>grizzled beard. Probably attends coursing matches. Pays his 
                        <lb n="52616"/>dues regularly but not plentifully to Father Dwyer of Larras. 
                        <lb n="52617"/>Sometimes talks to girls after nightfall. But his mother? Very 
                        <lb n="52618"/>young or very old? Hardly the first. If so, Cranly would not 
                        <lb n="52619"/>have spoken as he did. Old then. Probably: and neglected.

                        <lb n="52643"/>Not true. Have read little and understood less. Then she said I

                        <lb n="52645"/>means to leave church by backdoor of sin and reenter through 
                        <lb n="52646"/>the skylight of repentance. Cannot repent. Told her so and

                        <lb n="52652"/>with some sorrow. Then gave me recipe for what he calls

                        <lb n="52746"/>the west of Ireland (European and Asiatic papers please copy). 
                        <lb n="52747"/>He told us he met an old man there in a mountain cabin. Old 
                        <lb n="52748"/>man had red eyes and short pipe. Old man spoke Irish. 
                        <lb n="52749"/>Mulrennan spoke Irish. Then old man and Mulrennan spoke 
                        <lb n="52750"/>English. Mulrennan spoke to him about universe and stars. Old 
                        <lb n="52751"/>man sat, listened, smoked, spat. Then said: 
                        <lb n="52752"/><said who="???">―Ah, there must be terrible queer creatures at the latter end of 
                            <lb n="52753"/>the world.</said> </p>
                    <lb n="52754"/><p> I fear him. I fear his redrimmed horny eyes. It is with him I 
                        <lb n="52755"/>must struggle all through this night till day come, till he or I lie 
                        <lb n="52756"/>dead, gripping him by the sinewy throat till .... Till what? Till 
                        <lb n="52757"/>he yield to me? No. I mean him no harm. </p>
                    <lb n="52758"/><p> <emph>15 April:</emph> Met her today pointblank in <place><location><geo>53.342556 -6.259573</geo></location><placeName>Grafton Street</placeName></place>. The 
                        <lb n="52759"/>crowd brought us together. We both stopped. She asked me 
                        <lb n="52760"/>why I never came, said she had heard all sorts of stories about 
                        <lb n="52761"/>me. This was only to gain time. Asked me was I writing poems. 
                        <lb n="52762"/>About whom? I asked her. This confused her more and I felt 
                        <lb n="52763"/>sorry and mean. Turned off that valve at once and opened the 
                        <lb n="52764"/>spiritual-heroic refrigerating apparatus, invented and patented 
                        <lb n="52765"/>in all countries by Dante Alighieri. Talked rapidly of myself 
                        <lb n="52766"/>and my plans. In the midst of it unluckily I made a sudden 
                        <lb n="52767"/>gesture of a revolutionary nature. I must have looked like a 
                        <lb n="52768"/>fellow throwing a handful of peas up into the air. People began 
                        <lb n="52769"/>to look at us.  She shook hands a moment after and, in going 
                        <lb n="52770"/>away, said she hoped I would do what I said. </p>
                    <lb n="52771"/><p> Now I call that friendly, don't you? </p>
                    <lb n="52772"/><p> Yes. I liked her today. A little or much? Don't know. I liked 
                        <lb n="52773"/>her – and it seems a new feeling to me. Then, in that case, all 
                        <lb n="52774"/>the rest, all that I thought I thought and all that I felt I felt, all 
                        <lb n="52775"/>the rest before now, in fact ...... O, give it up, old chap! Sleep it 
                        <lb n="52776"/>off! </p>
                    <lb n="52777"/><p> <emph>16 April:</emph> Away! Away! </p>
                    <lb n="52778"/><p> The spell of arms and voices: the white arms of roads, their 
                        <lb n="52779"/>promise of close embraces and the black arms of tall ships that 
                        <lb n="52780"/>stand against the moon, their tale of distant nations. They are 
                        <lb n="52781"/>held out to say: We are alone. Come. And the voices say with 
                        <lb n="52782"/>them: We are your kinsmen.  And  the air is thick with their 
                        <lb n="52783"/>company as they call to me, their kinsman, making ready to go, 
                        <lb n="52784"/>shaking the wings of their exultant and terrible youth. </p>

                        <lb n="52787"/>and away from home and friends what the heart is and what it 
                        <lb n="52788"/>feels. Amen. So be it. Welcome, O life! I go to encounter for the 
                        <lb n="52789"/>millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the
